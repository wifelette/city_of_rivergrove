¹ **Primary Protected Water Features.** See definition of Protected Water Feature.  
² **Secondary Protected Water Features.** See definition of Protected Water Feature.  
³ Where the _Protected Water Feature_ is confined by a ravine or gully, the top of ravine is the break in the > 25% slope (see slope measurement in Appendix).  
⁴ A maximum reduction of 25 feet may be permitted in the width of _vegetated corridor_ beyond the slope break if a geotechnical report demonstrates that slope is stable. To establish the width of the _vegetated corridor_, slope should be measured in 25-foot increments away from the water feature until slope is less than 25% (top of ravine).  
⁵ _Vegetated corridors_ in excess of 50-feet for primary protected features, or in excess of 15-feet for secondary protected features apply on steep slopes only in the uphill direction from the _Protected Water Feature_.
⁶ Suggested method to determine two year recurrent flood elevations: obtain two year recurrent flood elevations from City of Tualatin at the Railroad Bridge Flood Gate, or, preferably, from the Lake Corp., at the head gate of the channel for Lake Oswego Canal, and extrapolate using FEMA flood-plain elevations.

**A.** All development in the City of Rivergrove, which may cause visible or measurable erosion, shall be subject to the following requirements:

1. Disturbed areas shall be immediately protected from erosion by water or wind through establishment of temporary vegetation and/or placement of temporary covering;
2. All temporary and permanent erosion prevention and sediment control measures shall be maintained and kept in working order during the period of disturbance and until permanent ground cover is established;
3. Temporary covering or vegetation used to protect disturbed areas shall be replaced with permanent vegetation or other permanent covering within one year of initial disturbance. Permanent vegetation should consist of plants native to the Tualatin River basin, where practicable;
4. Runoff from all developed areas shall be controlled to prevent erosion; and
5. Additional erosion prevention and sediment control measures may be required by the Planning Commission if existing requirements are deemed insufficient to prevent erosion on a particular site.

**B.** All development shall also comply with erosion prevention and sediment control requirements of other agencies with jurisdiction over the development site.

### Section VIII. Variances

**A.** Variances to this ordinance shall be processed pursuant to the procedures of the City of Rivergrove's variance procedures and shall also meet the criteria herein.

**B.** Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

**C.** Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

**D.** Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

**E.** Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. Showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
3. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
4. A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

**F.** Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

### Section IX. Map Administration

**A.** Maps showing the boundaries of Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this ordinance. The maps shall be kept on file at the offices of the City of Rivergrove and shall be available for inspection by the general public.

**B.** If boundary disputes arise, the Planning Commission may require a survey by a professional engineer, surveyor, geologist or other person trained in the delineation of Water Quality Resource Areas or Flood Management Areas to determine the precise location of Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas. Where such survey is required, the boundaries of the Water Quality Resource Area and Flood Management Area shall be delineated in the field by a professional engineer, surveyor, geologist, or other person trained in the delineation of wetlands or floodplains. The delineation shall then be surveyed by an Oregon Registered Land Surveyor. A copy of the survey shall be submitted to the Oregon Division of State Lands and/or FEMA when applicable.

### Section X. Consistency

Development shall be consistent with Oregon statewide planning goals and applicable federal requirements.

### Section XI. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability

The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Rivergrove, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

### Section XII. Severability and Interpretation

**A.** If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this ordinance should be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality thereof shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this ordinance.

**B.** Any conflict between the text of this ordinance and any heading, caption, figure, illustration, table or map is resolved in favor of the text.

### Section XIII. Enforcement

**A.** It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to violate any of the provisions of this ordinance or to fail to comply therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof.

**B.** In case any structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, maintained or used in violation of this ordinance, the City of Rivergrove may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunctive, mandamus or other appropriate proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance or use.

**C.** Any person who violates any provision of this ordinance commits an infraction. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense. Upon conviction, the violation is punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.

### Section XIV. Definitions

**"100-year flood"** means a flood that has an average frequency of occurrence of once in 100 years, although the flood may occur in any given year.

**"Base flood"** means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, also referred to as the "100-year flood." Designation on maps always includes the letter "A" or "V".

**"Base flood elevation"** means the water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).

**"Basement"** means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

**"Development"** means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard. "Development" includes significant alteration of vegetation and/or changes in surface permeability.

**"Flood"** or "flooding" means a general and temporary inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
2. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
3. Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph (2) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.

**"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)"** means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

**"Flood Management Area"** means the area that is inundated during a 100-year flood event as delineated on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and as may be revised according to the procedures set forth in Section 9 of this ordinance.

**"Floodplain or flood-prone area"** means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see "flooding").

**"Floodproofing"** means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

**"Floodway"** means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').

**"Lowest floor"** means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance.

**"Manufactured home"** means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

**"Protected Water Feature"** means lakes, wetlands, ponds, perennial streams, intermittent streams or other waterway shown on the United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) topographic maps or as may be determined according to the procedures set forth in Section 9 of this ordinance. Protected Water Features shall include the following:

1. **Primary Protected Water Features:** Streams identified on the United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) topographic maps, lakes 1/2 acre and larger in the summer, ponds 1/2 acre and larger that provide fish or wildlife habitat, constructed ponds and wetlands 1/2 acre and larger, seeps or springs, and wetlands as defined by the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual.

2. **Secondary Protected Water Features:** Constructed ponds and wetlands less than 1/2 acre that provide fish or wildlife habitat, seasonal streams that are tributaries to fish-bearing streams, and lakes and natural ponds less than 1/2 acre.

4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

**"Start of construction"** includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

**"Structure"** means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

**"Substantial improvement"** means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or
2. Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".

**"Water Quality Resource Area"** means the Protected Water Feature plus the vegetated corridor whose width is determined by the water feature type and the slope of the adjacent land as set forth in Table 1.

**"Variance"** means a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this ordinance.

**"Wetland"** or **"wetlands"** means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The upstream limit of a wetland is at the ordinary high water mark or at the limit of vegetation adapted to life in saturated soils, whichever is farther from the water body. Wetlands do not include constructed facilities such as irrigation delivery systems, irrigation infrastructure, irrigation canals, or other artificial watercourses unless they are used by fish or waterfowl habitat.

## **APPENDIX B**  

**SLOPE MEASUREMENT**

**Method One:** Calculate the slope as rise over run. To determine the rise: measure the vertical distance (in feet) between two points. To determine the run: measure the horizontal distance (in feet) between the same two points. The slope percentage is calculated as: (rise ÷ run) × 100.

**Method Two:** Use a clinometer to determine the slope.
