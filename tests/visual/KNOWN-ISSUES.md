# Known Visual Issues

## Meeting Pages UI Regression
**Date Identified**: January 2025  
**Status**: Not yet fixed  
**Pages Affected**: 
- `/minutes/*.html`
- `/agendas/*.html`
- `/transcripts/*.html`

**Description**: 
The Meeting pages are not showing the most recent version of the UI. There appears to be a regression that occurred during recent development work.

**Impact on Testing**:
- These pages should NOT be used as baseline references
- Visual tests for meeting pages should be skipped until fixed
- Once fixed, new baselines should be created

**Temporary Workaround**:
The test specs have been updated to skip Meeting pages until the regression is fixed.

## Safari Ordinance Page Layout Minor Difference
**Date Identified**: September 10, 2025  
**Status**: Acceptable, documented  
**Pages Affected**: 
- Safari browser ordinance page layout test only

**Description**: 
After Phase 3 CSS refactor (elimination of 40 !important declarations), Safari's ordinance page layout test shows pixel-level differences in automated comparison. Visual inspection shows no discernible difference between browsers.

**Root Cause**: 
CSS specificity changes from replacing `!important` with higher-specificity selectors may cause subtle rendering differences in Safari's layout engine.

**Impact on Testing**:
- 1 additional test failure (89 passed vs previous 90 passed)
- Visually identical to human eyes
- Does not affect functionality or user experience

**Resolution**: 
This is an acceptable trade-off for the architectural improvement of eliminating !important declarations. Future baseline updates may resolve this automatically.

## Action Items:
1. ✅ Document the issue
