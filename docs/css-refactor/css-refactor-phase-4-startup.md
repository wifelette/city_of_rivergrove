# CSS Architecture Refactor - Phase 4 Startup Prompt

## Initial Setup Instructions

**First, please read these essential context files:**
1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Project instructions and working preferences
2. **`docs/css-refactor-handoff.md`** - Current refactor status and context
3. **`CSS-REFACTOR-PHASE-3-COMPLETE.md`** - Detailed Phase 3 completion report

**Then review the current CSS architecture:**
- **`theme/css/main.css`** - Entry point showing modular structure
- **`theme/css/base/variables.css`** - Design token system (51+ variables)
- **`custom.css`** - Remaining styles to be migrated in Phase 4

**Current Status**: Phase 3 COMPLETE - Ready to begin Phase 4 (Component Migration)

## What Was Accomplished in Phase 3

### Major Achievement: 100% !important Declaration Elimination
- **Before**: 128 !important declarations causing maintenance nightmares
- **After**: 0 !important declarations - completely eliminated
- **Method**: Systematic replacement with higher-specificity selectors (`html .selector`)
- **Result**: Clean, maintainable CSS cascade with proper specificity

### Complete Modular Architecture Established
```
theme/css/
├── base/
│   └── variables.css          # 51+ design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
├── layout/
│   ├── mdbook-overrides.css   # Clean mdBook behavior fixes
│   └── page-structure.css     # General page layout & spacing
├── components/
│   ├── cards.css              # Landing page and document cards
│   ├── footnotes.css          # Document footnote styling
│   └── tables.css             # Table component styles
├── documents/
│   └── document-notes.css     # Document-specific styling
└── main.css                   # Single entry point managing all imports
```

### Testing Status: Excellent Stability
- **Visual Regression Tests**: 89/105 passing (84.8% pass rate)
- **Known Issues**: 16 failing tests are pre-existing navigation sidebar issues unrelated to refactor
- **Regression Analysis**: Zero new visual regressions introduced during refactor
- **Test Command**: `npm run build:verify` for full validation

## Branch Status
- **Current Branch**: `css-architecture-refactor`
- **Status**: All Phase 3 work committed and pushed to GitHub
- **Commit**: Contains 57 file changes, 2416 insertions, 477 deletions
- **Main Branch**: Clean and ready for eventual PR merge

## Phase 4: Component Migration (Next Step)

### Objective
Move remaining complex CSS from custom.css into modular component files while maintaining the clean architecture established in Phases 1-3.

### Key Areas to Address

1. **Navigation Components** (High Priority)
   - Extract multi-level sidebar navigation styles
   - Separate ordinance, resolution, and meeting navigation systems
   - Create reusable navigation component patterns
   - Current location: Scattered throughout custom.css

2. **Document Type-Specific Styling** (Medium Priority)
   - Ordinance-specific formatting (signatures, sections)
   - Resolution-specific patterns
   - Meeting transcript styling
   - Current location: Mixed in custom.css document sections

3. **Form and Interactive Elements** (Medium Priority)
   - Form field styling ({{filled:}} components)
   - Button and link treatments
   - Interactive state management
   - Current location: Utility sections of custom.css

4. **Responsive Design Consolidation** (Lower Priority)
   - Mobile-specific overrides
   - Print media queries
   - Responsive typography scales
   - Current location: Bottom of custom.css

### Expected Outcomes
- Further reduction in custom.css size and complexity
- Improved component reusability across document types
- Enhanced maintainability for future design system evolution
- Preserved visual fidelity through continued regression testing

## Technical Context

### CSS Variables Available (51+ tokens)
All design tokens are established and ready for use:
- **Colors**: Primary/secondary palettes, text colors, backgrounds
- **Spacing**: Padding, margin, gap scales (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl)
- **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, line heights
- **Layout**: Border radius, shadows, transitions
- **Borders**: Width, colors, styles

### Architecture Patterns Established
- Higher CSS specificity instead of !important declarations
- Consistent variable usage throughout
- Logical file organization by concern
- Single import entry point (main.css)
- Clean separation between mdBook overrides and custom styles

### Testing Infrastructure
- Visual regression testing with Playwright
- Automated build validation
- Known issues documented and tracked
- Development server with hot-reload (`./dev-server.sh`)

## Files to Review First

1. **`custom.css`** - Contains all remaining styles to be migrated
2. **`theme/css/main.css`** - Import structure and architecture
3. **`CSS-REFACTOR-PHASE-3-COMPLETE.md`** - Detailed completion report
4. **`docs/css-refactor-handoff.md`** - Current status and metrics
5. **Test results**: `npm run build:verify` to confirm current stability

## Command Quick Reference

- **Development**: `./dev-server.sh` (includes full processing pipeline)
- **Testing**: `npm run build:verify` (visual regression validation)
- **Single file testing**: `npx playwright test tests/visual.spec.js --grep="specific-page"`
- **Build validation**: `npm run build` (basic mdBook compilation)

## Success Metrics for Phase 4

- **Component Extraction**: Move 80%+ of remaining custom.css into modular files
- **Zero Regressions**: Maintain 89/105 visual test pass rate
- **Architecture Consistency**: All new components use CSS variables
- **Performance**: No increase in CSS bundle size despite modularization

## Instructions for Claude Code

**Your task:** Continue the CSS architecture refactor by beginning Phase 4 (Component Migration). 

**Steps to take:**
1. **Read the context files listed above** to understand the project and current state
2. **Run visual regression tests** (`npm run build:verify`) to establish baseline
3. **Begin component extraction** starting with navigation systems (highest priority)
4. **Use established patterns**: CSS variables, higher specificity (not !important), modular structure
5. **Test frequently** to ensure zero visual regressions throughout migration
6. **Update documentation** as components are extracted and organized

**Success criteria:**
- Extract 80%+ of remaining custom.css into modular component files
- Maintain 89/105 visual test pass rate (zero new regressions)
- Use CSS variables consistently throughout all new components
- Follow established architectural patterns from Phases 1-3

**Ready to Begin**: Phase 4 can start immediately with component extraction, beginning with navigation systems as the highest priority area.
