# Style Persistence Solution

## The Problem We Kept Encountering

Styles would appear and disappear repeatedly during development:
- Document Notes styling would vanish
- Enhanced formatting would be lost
- Tooltips would lose their styling
- The cycle would repeat endlessly

## Root Cause Discovery

The issue was a feedback loop:
1. We run postprocessors â†’ HTML files are enhanced with styling
2. mdBook detects file changes (from our postprocessors!)
3. mdBook rebuilds everything from scratch â†’ overwrites our enhancements
4. Styles disappear
5. We manually re-run postprocessors
6. Cycle repeats

This is why styles kept "appearing and disappearing" - every time mdBook detected ANY change, it would rebuild and wipe out our postprocessor enhancements.

## The Solution: Postprocess Watcher

Created `scripts/utils/mdbook-postprocess-watcher.sh` that:
- Monitors for mdBook rebuilds
- Detects when HTML lacks our enhancements
- Automatically re-runs postprocessors after mdBook finishes
- Includes cooldown to prevent infinite loops

Integrated into `dev-server.sh` to run alongside mdBook serve.

## Key Implementation Details

### Detection Method
```bash
# Check if index.html contains our enhanced markers
if ! grep -q "document-note" "$index_file" 2>/dev/null; then
    # File exists but doesn't have our enhancements - mdBook rebuilt!
    return 0
fi
```

### Cooldown Protection
```bash
POSTPROCESS_COOLDOWN=3  # Don't run more than once every 3 seconds
if [ $((current_time - LAST_POSTPROCESS_TIME)) -lt $POSTPROCESS_COOLDOWN ]; then
    return
fi
```

## Navigation Badges

The navigation badges for special states (Superseded, Never Passed) are:
- Implemented in `navigation-standalone.js`
- Pull data from `airtable-metadata.json`
- Display dynamically when JavaScript loads
- Currently exist for 4 documents:
  - Resolution #259-2018 (Superseded)
  - Resolution #256-2018 (Superseded)
  - Resolution #265-2019 (Never Passed)
  - Ordinance #69-2000 (Never Passed)

## Testing the Solution

1. Start dev server: `./dev-server.sh`
2. Watch the output for "ðŸ”„ Detected mdBook rebuild"
3. Verify "âœ… Postprocessors applied" follows
4. Check that Document Notes styling persists
5. Verify navigation badges appear for special state documents

## Why This Kept Happening

We kept missing this because:
- The cycle was intermittent (depended on what triggered rebuilds)
- We'd fix it temporarily by running postprocessors manually
- The root cause (mdBook detecting postprocessor changes) wasn't obvious
- Each "fix" would work until the next rebuild

## Lesson Learned

When styles disappear in mdBook:
- Don't just re-run postprocessors manually
- Check if mdBook is rebuilding and overwriting changes
- Implement automatic recovery mechanisms
- Monitor file modification times to detect rebuild cycles
