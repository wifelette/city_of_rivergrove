## Build System Refactor (August 30, 2025)

- **`build-system-audit.md`** - Analysis of problems with the old build system
- **`build-system-fix-plan.md`** - Implementation plan for the new simplified system

These documents were used to plan and execute the build system simplification that reduced 6+ confusing scripts down to 3 simple ones. The refactor has been completed and the new system is documented in:

- `/BUILD-QUICKSTART.md` - User guide for the new system
- `/docs/build-architecture.md` - Technical documentation (updated)
- `/scripts/SCRIPTS-GUIDE.md` - Script documentation (updated)
