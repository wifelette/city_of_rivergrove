To achieve this purpose it is necessary to regulate the design, quality of materials, construction, location, electrification, illumination, and maintenance of signs that are visible from public property, public rights-of-way and private areas open to public travel.</p>

<h3 id="section-4-general-requirements"><a class="header" href="#section-4-general-requirements">Section 4. General Requirements.</a></h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Except as provided in this ordinance, no person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish, equip, use or maintain any sign, or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> No owner shall erect or construct a sign on a site that contains unlawful signs.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> This ordinance shall not be construed to permit the erection or maintenance of any sign at any place or in any manner unlawful under any other city code provision or other applicable law.

<p><strong>D.</strong> This ordinance is not intended to, and does not restrict speech on the basis of its content, viewpoint or message. Any classification of signs in this ordinance that permits speech by reason of the type of sign, identity of the sign user or otherwise, shall permit any type of speech on the sign. No part of this ordinance shall be construed to favor commercial speech over non-commercial speech. To the extent any provision of this ordinance is ambiguous, the term shall be interpreted to not regulate on the basis of speech content, and the interpretation resulting in the least restriction on the content of the sign message shall prevail.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is declared invalid for any reason by a court having jurisdiction under state or federal law, the remaining portions of this ordinance shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>Temporary signs shall be kept neat, clean and in good repair. Signs that are faded, torn, damaged or otherwise unsightly or in a state of disrepair shall be immediately repaired or removed.

<p><strong>A.</strong> The City Manager may remove or may order the removal of any sign erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this ordinance or other applicable provisions of this code. Signs installed in violation of any prior sign code or applicable laws and regulations, and which are in violation of this ordinance, shall be removed, replaced or altered in order to conform to the requirements of this ordinance. An order to remove a sign shall be in writing and mailed to the owner of the sign or the owner of the building, structure or premises on which the sign is located.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> The order shall inform the owner that the sign violates the regulations in this ordinance and must be brought into compliance or be removed within 30 days of the date of the order. The City Manager may order immediate removal of a sign under subsection (G) of this section.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> If the owner fails to immediately remove an unsafe sign or otherwise fails to file an appeal or remove a sign within 30 days of the date of the City Manager’s order, or within the time provided in the decision rendered following an appeal, the City Manager shall cause the sign to be removed. The removal shall be at the expense of the owner of the sign or the owner of the building, structure, or premises on which the sign is located.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> These costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, the notification, efforts to secure compliance, painting out of a sign, sign removal, storage, transportation and attorneys fees, shall be a lien against land or premises on which the sign is located, and may be collected or foreclosed in the same manner as liens that are entered in the liens docket of the City of Rivergrove.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Instead of removing a sign, the City Manager may file charges against the sign owner in Rivergrove municipal court. Each day following the 30 day period in which the sign owner is not in compliance with this ordinance constitutes a separate violation.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Any sign installed or placed on public property, except in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance, shall be forfeited to the city and confiscated. Removal costs may be collected as provided in section 13 of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> If the City Manager finds that any sign is in violation of the applicable provision of this code and that, by reason of its condition, it presents an immediate and serious danger to the public, the City Manager may, without prior written notice, order the immediate removal or repair of the sign within a specified period. The City Manager may remove or authorize others to remove the sign in the event that the person responsible for such sign cannot be found or if that person, after notification, refuses to repair or remove it. The owner of the sign and the owner of the building, structure, or premises on which the sign is located, are jointly and severably liable for the cost of removing such sign as provided for in section 13 of this ordinance.</p>
