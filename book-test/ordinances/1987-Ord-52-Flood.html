<h3 id="section-10"><a class="header" href="#section-10">SECTION 1.0</a></h3>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<h4 id="11-statutory-authorization"><a class="header" href="#11-statutory-authorization">1.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION</a></h4>
<p>The Legislature of the State of <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Oregon</span> has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council</span> of <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Rivergrove, Oregon</span>, does ordain as follows:</p>
<h4 id="12-findings-of-fact"><a class="header" href="#12-findings-of-fact">1.2 FINDINGS OF FACT</a></h4>
<p>(1) The flood hazard areas of <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Rivergrove</span> are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.</p>
<h4 id="13-statement-of-purpose"><a class="header" href="#13-statement-of-purpose">1.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</a></h4>
<p>It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:</p>
<p>(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
(7) To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and,
(8) To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.</p>
<h4 id="14-methods-of-reducing-flood-losses"><a class="header" href="#14-methods-of-reducing-flood-losses">1.4 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES</a></h4>
<p>In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for:</p>
<p>(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.</p>

<h3 id="section-20"><a class="header" href="#section-20">SECTION 2.0</a></h3>
<p><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p>Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application.</p>
<p><strong>“APPEAL”</strong> means a request for a review of the <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council’s</span> interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.</p>
<p><strong>“AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING”</strong> means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and, velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.</p>
<p><strong>“AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD”</strong> means the land in the flood plain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.</p>
<p><strong>“BASE FLOOD”</strong> means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.” Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.</p>
<p><strong>“DEVELOPMENT”</strong> means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard.</p>
<p><strong>“FLOOD”</strong> or <strong>“FLOODING”</strong> means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(1) The overflow of inland or tidal waters and/or
(2) The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.</p>
<p><strong>“FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)”</strong> means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.</p>
<p><strong>“FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY”</strong> means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.</p>
<p><strong>“FLOODWAY”</strong> means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.</p>
<p><strong>“LOWEST FLOOR”</strong> means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance found at Section 5.2-1(2).</p>
<p><strong>“MANUFACTURED HOME”</strong> means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term “manufactured home” does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>“MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION”</strong> means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.</p>
<p><strong>“New Construction”</strong> means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>“START OF CONSTRUCTION”</strong> includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.</p>
<p><strong>“STRUCTURE”</strong> means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.</p>
<p><strong>“SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT”</strong> means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:
(1) before the improvement or repair is started, or
(2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.</p>
<p>The term does not, however, include either:
(1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
(2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.</p>
<p><strong>“VARIANCE”</strong> means a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this ordinance.</p>

The Flood Insurance Study is on file at <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">4640 S.W. Dogwood Dr</span>.</p>
<h4 id="33-penalties-for-noncompliance"><a class="header" href="#33-penalties-for-noncompliance">3.3 PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE</a></h4>
<p>No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">$500.00</span> or imprisoned for not more than <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">30</span> days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Rivergrove</span> from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.</p>
<h4 id="34-abrogation-and-greater-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#34-abrogation-and-greater-restrictions">3.4 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS</a></h4>
<p>This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.</p>
<h4 id="35-interpretation"><a class="header" href="#35-interpretation">3.5 INTERPRETATION</a></h4>
<p>In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements;
(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.</p>
<h4 id="36-warning-and-disclaimer-of-liability"><a class="header" href="#36-warning-and-disclaimer-of-liability">3.6 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</a></h4>
<p>The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.

<h4 id="44-variance-procedure"><a class="header" href="#44-variance-procedure">4.4 VARIANCE PROCEDURE</a></h4>
<h4 id="44-1-appeal-board"><a class="header" href="#44-1-appeal-board">4.4-1 Appeal Board</a></h4>
<p>(1) The <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council</span> as established by <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Rivergrove</span> shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance.
(2) The <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council</span> shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Planning Commission in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
(3) Those aggrieved by the decision of the <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council</span> or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Land Use Board of Appeals</span>, as provided in State law.
(4) In passing upon such applications, the <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council</span> shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and:
(i) the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(ii) the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(iii) the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(iv) the importance of the services provide by the proposed facility to the community;
(v) the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
(vi) the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(vii) the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(viii) the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area;
(ix) the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(x) the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and,
(xi) the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.</p>
<p>(5) Upon consideration of the factors of Section 4.4-1(4) and the purposes of this ordinance, the <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council</span> may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
(6) The <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Recorder</span> shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.</p>
<h4 id="44-2-conditions-for-variances"><a class="header" href="#44-2-conditions-for-variances">4.4-2 Conditions for Variances</a></h4>
<p>(1) Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (i-xi) in Section 4.4-1(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(i) a showing of good and sufficient cause;
(ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
(iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section 4.1-4(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
(7) Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except 4.4-2(1), and otherwise complies with Sections 5.1-1 and 5.1-2 of the GENERAL STANDARDS.
(8) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.</p>

<h4 id="51-5-review-of-building-permits"><a class="header" href="#51-5-review-of-building-permits">5.1-5 Review of Building Permits</a></h4>
<p>Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source (Section 4.3-2), Applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.</p>
<h4 id="52-specific-standards"><a class="header" href="#52-specific-standards">5.2 SPECIFIC STANDARDS</a></h4>
<p>In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 3.2, BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD or Section 4.3-2, Use of Other Base Flood Data, the following provisions are required:</p>
<h4 id="52-1-residential-construction"><a class="header" href="#52-1-residential-construction">5.2-1 Residential Construction</a></h4>
<p>(1) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation.
(2) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
(i) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
(iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.</p>
<h4 id="52-2-nonresidential-construction"><a class="header" href="#52-2-nonresidential-construction">5.2-2 Nonresidential Construction</a></h4>
<p>New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:</p>
<p>(1) be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
(2) have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
(3) be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the floodproofing criteria in Section 5.2-2; and
(4) The specific plans and specifications and an operational plan based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting criteria in Section 4.3-2(2)
(5) Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest elevated floor as described for residential structures.</p>
