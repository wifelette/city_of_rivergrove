City shall have thirty (30) days to provide a written response to such disputed entry. Applicant shall submit full payment for the invoice with the disputed entry by the agreed upon timeline in section (3) above and City shall credit a subsequent invoice if it determines that the disputed charge should be credited to Applicant. If applicant continues to dispute an entry, it shall request arbitration under section (5) below within fifteen (15) days of transmittal of the City’s written response.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong> Applicant or City may at any time request final and binding arbitration of any dispute relating to invoices, costs, or payments due, but in no event does this Agreement extend the statute of limitations under Oregon law. Any party who fails to submit to binding arbitration following a lawful demand by the other party shall bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees (including those incurred in any trial, bankruptcy proceeding, appeal or review) incurred by the other party who must seek court assistance to enforce these arbitration provisions. A party may request arbitration by giving written notice to that effect to the other party, specifying in the notice the nature of the dispute. The dispute shall be heard and determined in the City of Rivergrove, Oregon, by a single arbitrator agreed upon by the parties. If an agreement cannot be reached, then the arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the rules then pertaining to the Clackamas County Circuit Court Arbitration Program, except to the extent provided otherwise under Oregon laws on arbitration and as otherwise provided herein. If such program is terminated, then the rules of the Arbitration Services of Portland, Inc. shall be used.</p>
<p>a. The prevailing party shall recover fees and expenses of any arbitration under section (5), including all of its attorneys and experts fees.</p>
<p>b. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of the State of Oregon. The arbitrator shall have no authority or jurisdiction to award any damages or any other remedies beyond those that could have been awarded in a court of law had the parties litigated the claims in court instead of arbitrating them. The parties shall not assert any claim for punitive damages except to the extent such awards are specifically authorized by statute.</p>
<p>c. The parties shall use their best efforts to complete any arbitration within sixty (60) days of the filing of the dispute. The arbitrator shall be empowered to impose sanctions for any party’s failure to do so. These arbitration provisions shall survive any termination, amendment, or expiration of the Agreement unless the parties otherwise expressly agree in writing. Each party agrees to keep all disputes and arbitration proceedings strictly confidential, except for the disclosure of information required in the ordinary course of business of the parties or as required by applicable law or regulation. Any time limitation (such as the statute of limitations or laches) that would bar litigation of a claim shall also bar arbitration of the claim. If any provision of this arbitration program is declared invalid by any court, the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby and shall remain fully enforceable. The parties understand that they have decided that on demand of either of them, their disputes as described herein will be resolved by final and binding arbitration rather than in a court.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Should the arbitrator find in favor of the City, the City shall have the right to enforce that right through entry of judgment and seek a lien against any property owned by applicant and applicant waives all objections against the entry of judgment or lien.</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Appellant has submitted to City an Appeal pursuant to the Rivergrove Code; and</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, City is obligated by state law and City Code to review this Appeal, and determine whether it complies with the approval criteria and standards of state law and City’s ordinances and development standards; and</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the parties are uncertain about the total costs of land use planners, engineers or attorneys necessary to review and process the Appeal;</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, ORS 227.175 authorizes City to charge Appellants for the actual cost of processing Appeals and the City has elected to do so under <a href="../ordinances/1989-Ord-54-89C-Land-Development.html">Ordinance #54-89</a> Section 9.030 (the City’s right to charge for fees incurred by the City for legal services, engineering services, planning services, etc), Resolution 200-2005 (a fee schedule), and <a href="../resolutions/2018-Res-256-Planning-Development-Fees.html">Resolution 256</a>- 2018 (amending the fee schedule); and</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, if actual costs are less than the deposit, a refund will be given.</p>
<p><strong>NOW THEREFORE</strong>, the premises being generally stated in the foregoing Recitals, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Appellant agrees to be responsible for paying the actual costs incurred by City in reviewing the aforesaid Appeal for compliance with the applicable approval criteria, development and design standards.</p>
<p>a. Such costs shall include the actual costs of City’s land use planners, engineers and attorneys incurred in reviewing that Appeal.</p>
<p>b. Prior to the City undertaking review of any Appeal of a land use application, the Appellant shall submit a deposit of $250.</p>
<p>Where the City’s actual cost of review of the Appeal does not amount to the total deposit, a refund to the Appellant of any remaining balance of the deposit shall be issued within sixty (60) days of issuance of the land use decision.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Appellant agrees to be responsible for paying the actual costs incurred by City in inspecting and verifying Appellant’s Appeal with any representations made in its letter of Appeal and with any requirements of City’s development and design standards.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Appellant agrees that the City will issue monthly invoices for costs incurred and Appellant is required to remit payment within thirty (30) days of the City-issued invoice date. Overdue balances remain overdue until paid in full (including all late payment fees and interest charges.) All overdue accounts will be charged a late payment fee of $50 or 3% of the overdue balance, whichever is greater, each billing cycle. Interest at the rate of 9% on the unpaid balance, calculated daily and compounded monthly, will also be charged to all overdue accounts from the date of the original billing, each billing cycle. Accounts paid in a timely manner will not be charged any accrued interest.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Appellant shall raise any dispute about an entry on an invoice in writing within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date. City shall have thirty (30) days to provide a written response to such disputed entry. Appellant shall submit full payment for the invoice with the disputed entry by the agreed upon timeline in section (3) above and City shall credit a subsequent invoice if it determines that the disputed charge should be credited to Appellant. If Appellant continues to dispute an entry, it shall request arbitration under section (5) below within fifteen (15) days of transmittal of the City’s written response.</p>
