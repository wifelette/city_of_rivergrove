# Testing MCP Connection for Airtable Sync

## Current Status

✅ **MCP Server is running** (PID: 83919)  
✅ **Tools are configured** in daily-claude server  
✅ **Sync script is ready** with mock data fallback  
❓ **MCP tools need Claude Desktop** to execute  

## How to Test the Connection

### Option 1: Use Claude Desktop (Recommended)

Open a regular Claude Desktop chat (not Claude Code) and run:

```
Test 1: List one ordinance
council_ordinances_list maxRecords:1

Test 2: Check existing metadata  
council_public_metadata_list maxRecords:5

Test 3: See what Resolution 259-2018 looks like
council_ordinances_search query:"259-2018" maxRecords:1
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing with the Sync Script

1. **Dry run to see what would happen:**
   ```bash
   node airtable-sync.js --setup --test-single --dry-run
   ```
   
2. **The script will show:**
   - Which files it found in the repo (22 documents mapped)
   - What MCP commands it would run
   - Which Public Metadata records would be created

3. **Example output for Resolution 259-2018:**
   - File: `Resolutions/2018-Res-#259-Planning-Development-Fees.md`
   - Would create Public Metadata with:
     - Document: Link to recOrd259
     - Publication Status: Draft
     - Digitization Notes: (empty)
     - Public Tags: (empty)

## What We've Accomplished

1. ✅ Created `airtable-sync.js` that:
   - Maps repository files to Airtable document IDs
   - Identifies missing Public Metadata records
   - Has safe test modes (--dry-run, --test-single)
   - Falls back to mock data when MCP unavailable

2. ✅ Identified the workflow:
   - Run script to analyze what needs syncing
   - Script outputs the MCP commands needed
   - Execute commands through Claude Desktop

3. ✅ Successfully mapped 22 documents including:
   - 19 Ordinances
   - 3 Resolutions
   - Ready to create metadata for all

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real data**: Run the MCP commands in Claude Desktop to verify Airtable access
2. **Create first record**: Start with Resolution 259-2018 as test case
3. **Batch process**: Once verified, process remaining documents
4. **Add digitization notes**: Update records with notes from documents

- `airtable-commands.md` - MCP command reference
- `test-mcp-connection.md` - This testing guide
- `test-airtable-setup.js` - Helper test script (can be removed)
