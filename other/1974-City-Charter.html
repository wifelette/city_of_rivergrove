<p><strong>Section 34. Enacting Clause.</strong><br/>
The enacting clause of all ordinances hereafter enacted shall be, “The city of Rivergrove ordains as follows:”</p>
<p><strong>Section 35. Mode of Enactment.</strong><br/>
(1) Except as the second and third paragraphs of this section provide to the contrary, every ordinance of the council shall, before being put upon its final passage, be read fully and distinctly in open council meeting on two different days.</p>
<p>(2) Except as the third paragraph of this section provides to the contrary, an ordinance may be enacted at a single meeting of the council by unanimous vote of all council members present, upon being read first in full and then by title.</p>
<p>(3) Any of the readings may be by title only if no council member present at the meeting requests to have the ordinance read in full or if a copy of the ordinance is provided for each council member and three copies are provided for public inspection in the office of the city recorder not later than one week before the first reading of the ordinance and if notice of their availability is given forthwith upon the filing, by written notice posted at the city hall and two other public places in the city or by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. An ordinance enacted after being read by title alone may have no legal effect if it differs substantially from its terms as it was thus filed prior to such reading, unless each section incorporating such difference is read fully and distinctly in open council meeting as finally amended prior to being approved by the council.</p>
<p>(4) Upon the final vote on an ordinance, the ayes and nays of the members shall be taken and entered in the record of proceedings.</p>
<p>(5) Upon the enactment of an ordinance the recorder shall sign it with the date of its passage and his name and title of office, and within three days thereafter the mayor shall sign it with the date of his signature, his name and the title of his office.</p>
<p><strong>Section 36. When Ordinances Take Effect.</strong><br/>
An ordinance enacted by the council shall take effect on the thirtieth day after its enactment. When the council deems it advisable, however, an ordinance may provide a later time for it to take effect, and in case of an emergency, it may take effect immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Section 37. Condemnation.</strong><br/>
Any necessity of taking property for the city by condemnation shall be determined by the council and declared by a resolution of the council describing the property and stating the uses to which it shall be devoted.</p>
<p><strong>Section 38. Improvements.</strong><br/>
The procedure for making, altering, vacating, or abandoning a public improvement shall be governed by general ordinance or, to the extent not so governed, by the applicable general laws of the state. Action on any proposed public improvement, except a sidewalk or except an improvement unanimously declared by the council to be needed at once because of an emergency, shall be suspended for six months upon a remonstrance thereto by the owners of two-thirds of the land to be specially assessed therefor. Joint owners of land must be in unanimous agreement for inclusion of their land in the two-thirds rule. In this section “owner” shall mean the record holder of legal title or, where land is being purchased under a land sale contract recorded or verified to the recorder in writing by the record holder of legal title to the land, the purchaser shall be deemed the “owner.”</p>
<p><strong>Section 39. Special Assessments.</strong><br/>
The procedure for levying, collecting, and enforcing the payment of special assessments for public improvements or other services to be charged against real property shall be governed by general ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>Section 40. Bids.</strong><br/>
A contract in excess of $250.00 for a public improvement to be made by a private contractor shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder for the contract and shall be done in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the council.</p>
<p><strong>Section 41. Debt Limit.</strong><br/>
Except by consent of the voters, the city’s voluntary floating indebtedness shall not exceed 1% of the assessed valuation of the city; nor its bonded indebtedness exceed 3% at any one time. For purposes of calculating the limitation, however, the legally authorized debt of the city in existence at the time this charter takes effect shall not be considered. All city officials and employees who create or officially approve any indebtedness in excess of this limitation shall be jointly and severally liable for the excess.</p>
<p><strong>Section 42. Torts.</strong><br/>
In no event shall the city be liable in damages for an injury to person, a damage to property, or a death, caused by a defect or a dangerous condition in a public thoroughfare, site, or facility, unless the city has had actual notice prior to the injury, damage, or death that the defect or condition existed and has had a reasonable time thereafter in which to repair or remove it. In no case shall more than $500 be recovered as damages for an injury, damage, or death resulting from such a defect or dangerous place. No action shall be maintained against the city for damages growing out of such injury, damage, or death unless the claimant first gives written notice to the council, within the time limitations provided by Oregon statute, after the injury, damage, or death is sustained, stating specifically the time when, the place where, and the circumstances under which it was sustained, and that he will claim damages therefor of the city in an amount which he specifies. But in no event shall the action be started until 60 days have elapsed after the presentation of this notice to the council.</p>
<p><strong>Section 43. Existing Ordinances Continued.</strong><br/>
All ordinances of the city consistent with this charter and in force when it takes effect shall remain in effect until amended or repealed.</p>
<p><strong>Section 44. Repeal of Previously Enacted Provisions.</strong><br/>
All charter provisions of the city enacted prior to the time that this charter takes effect are hereby repealed.</p>
<p><strong>Section 45. Amendment.</strong><br/>
(1) This charter may be amended by the voters at a regular or special election.</p>
<p>(2) An ordinance to refer an amendment to the voters shall be adopted at least 60 calendar days before the election at which the measure is to be voted upon and shall be effective upon the signature of the presiding officer of the council.</p>
<p>(3) An initiative petition proposing a charter amendment shall be filed with the officer in charge of elections at least 90 calendar days before the election at which the measure is to come before the voters. If a petition is filed and the council calls a special election on the measure, the election may not be held sooner than 90 calendar days after the call.</p>
<p><strong>Section 46. Time of Effect of Charter.</strong><br/>
This charter shall take effect 30 days after approval by the voters.</p>
