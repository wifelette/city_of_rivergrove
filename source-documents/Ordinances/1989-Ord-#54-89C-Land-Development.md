(c) The decision of the Planning Commission, with regards to a matter requiring a Type III hearing shall be based upon the Policies set forth in the Comprehensive Plan, the standards established on the Land Development Ordinance, and the factual evidence presented at the Public Hearing. The Commission shall make findings which explain the basis for the approval or denial of each particular proposal.

### Section 4.120. Type IV Procedure.

"Proposed Developments which are subject to a Site Design Review shall be considered by the Commission sitting as the Site Review Committee. All Site Design Reviews which occur within an environmentally sensitive area shall be processed under the Type III procedure. The review of a multi-family development outside of an Environmentally Sensitive Area shall be conducted under a Type III procedure."

Notice shall be given to all owners of land located within 200 feet of the property to be developed.

When an annexation proposal has been initiated and the (planning director) has determined the territory is eligible for annexation it shall be referred to the planning commission. The commission shall base its recommendation on whether the following criteria have been met:

(1) The proposal conforms to the comprehensive plan or substantial changes in conditions have occurred which render the comprehensive plan inapplicable to the annexation.

(2) The inclusion of the territory within the city would be consistent with the purpose served by the city.

Although the city council shall make affirmative findings on the two criteria if it proceeds with the annexation, proceedings may be terminated by the council at any time.

### Section 6.236. Designation of Annexed Property. 
Territory annexed to the city shall remain subject to the land development regulations of the county until changed by the city. Such change may be entirely or partially carried out as a part of the annexation proceedings if included in the Type IV proceedings of the council. Within thirty days after the effective date of annexation the city recorder shall report on any further steps that appear necessary to have the annexed territory fully subject to the provisions of this ordinance and shall initiate appropriate action to have those steps carried out. If the city council finds it is important to the protection or implementation of city policies, interim regulations may be applied in the annexed area until more permanent action can be taken.
