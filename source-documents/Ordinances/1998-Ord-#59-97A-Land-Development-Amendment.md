# ORDINANCE NO. 59-97A

**BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF RIVERGROVE, OREGON**

**WHEREAS,** the City of Rivergrove has adopted a Comprehensive Plan and Land Development Ordinance to guide and control its future development; and

**WHEREAS,** the preservation of the City's character was and continues to be one of the primary goals of the City and its residents; and

**WHEREAS,** the current Land Development Ordinance lacks critical elements and provisions necessary to allow the City to guide and control its future development in a manner which will preserve the City's character; and

**WHEREAS,** the current Metro Urban Growth Management Functional Plan does not anticipate nor require a minimum level of increased development and population growth within the City of Rivergrove; and

**WHEREAS,** the regional housing density and mix standards as stated in OAR 660-07-030 and sections (1), (2), and (3) of OAR 660-07-035 do not apply to the City of Rivergrove because it is a small developed city which had less than 50 acres of buildable land in 1977; and

**WHEREAS,** the Land Development Ordinance as amended will still provide for and allow substantial new development and population growth (restricted to some extent by the limited amount of buildable land inside the City -- a matter not affected by these amendments);

**NOW THEREFORE THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF RIVERGROVE ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:** The Comprehensive Plan and the Land Development Ordinance are hereby amended as follows:
