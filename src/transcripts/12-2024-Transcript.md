[00:00:00] **Chris Barhyte:** [00:01:00] [00:02:00] [00:03:00] [00:04:00] All right.

[00:04:17] **Analeis Weidlich:** Are we ready? 

[00:04:18] **Chris Barhyte:** I think so. Do we have everybody on? 

[00:04:24] **Analeis Weidlich:** We're missing, uh, Rachel and uh, Leah. 

[00:04:29] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Maybe give it a couple seconds

[00:04:37] **Analeis Weidlich:** Here's Rachel.

[00:04:49] **Chris Barhyte:** We'll give maybe Leah another minute and then we'll go. 

[00:04:55] **Analeis Weidlich:** Yeah, I sent her a text but I didn't hear back.[00:05:00] 

[00:05:04] And anybody who doesn't have their, um, last names on, if you could please put that on your thing for our, uh, note taking in our minutes. I know we have a J Dub, so whoever that is, please put your last name. It looks like we have L-A-T-E-R. We need to put their last name, whoever that is, for the record, for our minutes.

[00:05:32] **Chris Barhyte:** All right. I think Leah, I see Leah's on, but I, I see she's got her note taker. 

[00:05:37] **Analeis Weidlich:** Note taking is on, but I'm not sure. Maybe this L-I-T-E-R is her. 

[00:05:42] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah,

[00:05:46] **Analeis Weidlich:** I'm not sure. Anyway. All right. 

[00:05:49] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Well, let's call the, uh, December 9th meeting of the Rivergrove City Council to order and we'll do roll call. 

[00:05:58] **Analeis Weidlich:** Okay, so [00:06:00] we have December 9th, Monday City Council roll call. Bill Tuttle. Chris Barhyte. 

[00:06:07] **Chris Barhyte:** Here. 

[00:06:08] **Analeis Weidlich:** Rachel Schaeffer. 

[00:06:09] **Rachel Schaefer:** Here. 

[00:06:10] **Analeis Weidlich:** Doug McClain here. Uh, Leah Silber.

[00:06:18] Um, 

[00:06:20] **Chris Barhyte:** I think she's going to be here. 

[00:06:22] **Analeis Weidlich:** I, I'm not quite sure. Oh, there she is. 

[00:06:24] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. You see her? 

[00:06:26] **Analeis Weidlich:** There we go. Now where's she going? 

[00:06:31] **Chris Barhyte:** There she is. Oh. Leah. Leah, are you here? 

[00:06:33] **Analeis Weidlich:** Leah? You here?

[00:06:37] Okay, well I see her. We see her thing that Leah's here. 

[00:06:41] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. So, um, presentation from outside agencies. I have not been told that we have any of those. So we'll pa pass right by that, uh, planning commission report. And then, um, Alan, I was gonna have you just, if you don't mind, it's up to you, but if you could just stay really [00:07:00] quickly for the first agenda item.

[00:07:02] Just, uh, if you don't mind, just right after your report. Oh, you're on mute by the way. 

[00:07:08] **Analeis Weidlich:** Oh, hold on, hold on.

[00:07:16] **Alan Stonewall:** I think, oh, 

[00:07:16] **Chris Barhyte:** there you go. 

[00:07:17] **Analeis Weidlich:** Yeah, there you go. 

[00:07:18] **Alan Stonewall:** Okay. Yeah, I'm planning on staying for the meeting, so I'm happy. Oh, 

[00:07:22] **Chris Barhyte:** okay. Alright, great. So, um, we're gonna go to the part of the agenda where any member of the public that would like to speak on a non agenda item, this would be your time to raise your hand. 

[00:07:35] **Analeis Weidlich:** Wait, 

[00:07:35] but isn't Alan gonna give us planning commission report first?

[00:07:38] **Chris Barhyte:** Oh, you're right. Geez. Excuse me. I was thinking that was later. You're right. Thank you. Thank you for keeping on straight there, Alan. You're up. 

[00:07:46] **Alan Stonewall:** All right, thank you. I will give the planning commission report. I noted that both of the agenda items from our last planning commission meeting last week are also agenda items on the city council's agenda for today.[00:08:00] 

[00:08:00] So I don't have a need to go through them in great detail. We'll go through them or you will go through them, uh, as they show up as agenda items for this meeting. The two items are the. Uh, uh, the new FEMA hazard rules that have to be adopted and applied in, in some manner. And we've started that process, but we just, um, had a process or the new rules introduced to us, and that's it.

[00:08:28] So we've taken and have no action to take at this point, but we're aware of what needs to be done. And then we, then we've got an unpermitted, um, gate issue, which is also on the agenda for this city council meeting. And it raises a re, uh, issue of enforcement. You know, if there needs to be enforcement, who decides, is that a planning commission issue?

[00:08:55] Is that a city council issue? What are our enforcement [00:09:00] authorities and responsibilities? And how do we en enforce compliance? And we're not looking for an answer, but just realize that. Uh, from a planning commission standpoint, we don't know right now. So that's something we'll hope to get worked out over the next couple of meetings.

[00:09:20] And along those same lines, I started looking at that. I don't think I have a good handle on the duties, responsibilities, assignments, authority of the planning commission. I went looking for ordinances or the ordinance that lays that out. And I haven't found it. I'm not sure there is an it. I'm, I think it's more likely that our responsibilities are sprinkled throughout the ordinances and various issues related to, uh, ordinance for each of those issues.

[00:09:53] And so I really need some help in getting my hands around that and so we can know [00:10:00] what we can should, and should not be doing. Um. So that's something. Um, just to give you an example, um, the Stark Street boat ramp will be coming before the planning commission at some point in time. Kelly's firm, our city engineers firm, has worked in preparing that, uh, helping to prepare that application.

[00:10:24] So is it appropriate at all that she then advised the planning commission on our review of it? And if not, do I have the authority to hire someone else to spend money? I don't think so, but I don't know. Um, and I don't know where to look to find out, you know, how I would handle this situation. So that's just an example that, that came up recently.

[00:10:49] Um, so I'm gonna be spending some time in some manner. I'm not sure how yet to try to get my handle, my hands around that I. [00:11:00] And so that's it. That's the report. 

[00:11:03] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah. And, and that's a really good question. I guess I should, uh, we as a council should find out what other cities do when it comes to city applying for permits within the city, which is a common activity in a lot of cities.

[00:11:16] So how does, how do other cities handle that? Do they, I don't know. So that's a good question. In the past, I think when the city's done stuff, it's always been handled in-house by staff and a presentation from staff to the planning commission. So we need to get an answer on that. Uh, okay. So public. Oh, did Doug, did you have a question for the planning commission?

[00:11:41] **Doug McLean:** I just, I was just gonna say, I don't think the planning commission, per se, has any authority delegated to 'em, do they? Um, I think everything they, they decide then comes to the city council, goes to the manager. Then all of that is decided at either one of those places. [00:12:00] It's been my impression over the years anyway, 

[00:12:04] **Alan Stonewall:** there, there are some, um, responsibilities assigned to us in the, um, land development ordinance, but it's fairly broad.

[00:12:17] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah, so I mean, when a point when something comes to you as a, I mean, that's your authority right there. So if there's a development in front of you, you can make comments, uh, requirements. If the applicant, they can appeal that. Both parties can appeal it back to the council. But you have definitely authority in that function of the code.

[00:12:40] Now, the planning Commission also can recommend ordinances back to the council, but the council can also send recommendations back to you to look at, you know, an ordinance or things like that. So that's one reason that planning. The city code violation came back to you guys, to the planning commission first was just [00:13:00] say, do you, what are your thoughts on this?

[00:13:02] What recommendation would you have? What do you, now the council has to pass the ordinance, but you can, you guys can start the conversation to bring something back to us and then clearly have authority over planning. 

[00:13:15] **Leah Silber:** I would say in terms of conflict of interest, we don't, um, have, I'm, we're not, the, the concern is not like, oh, the city is going to do something that is good for the city.

[00:13:24] 'cause that's the actual job. Right. But the conflict of interest stuff that we have to look out for is like, is Kelly Chris's cousin? Right. That kind of stuff. Which it could happen on a, at a city of our scale, but I don't. If we're thinking of conflict of interest, then the policy stuff we should be be evaluating are like, what are the things that we should disclose when someone joins the planning commission about relationships with other vendors and things like that.

[00:13:48] But Kelly, being someone that we hired shouldn't make them someone that we can't trust 'cause that's why we hired them. Um, but this is all like par for the course kind of stuff. So I'm sure we can find model policies [00:14:00] from other cities to see how it's handled. Um, in a cursory research, what you find for this kind of like what's a conflict of interest is not like the planning commission has to hire their own attorneys to, or their own firms to like double check the money they're already paying to other firms, but rather people have to disclose if they have relationships with any of these vendors.

[00:14:19] Um, and that obviously would be a problem. 

[00:14:22] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah, I think the issue that Alan's bringing up, and it's an interesting issue is, and other cities deal with this, is normally the applicant. The applicant and the, and the staff are two different parties. So his issue is if we're the, if the city's the applicant submitting an application to the planning commission.

[00:14:40] Yeah, 

[00:14:40] **Leah Silber:** but I'm saying like, 

[00:14:42] **Chris Barhyte:** I mean, I agree with you though. I I do. If you 

[00:14:44] **Leah Silber:** have a job, it's like if your job is to open and close the door, it's not a conflict of interest to open and close the door for yourself. Yeah. Right Now, in fact, if it did appear that there was some specific malfeasance going on, then people should bring it up and should file complaints.

[00:14:56] But, uh, just because some of the legislation and [00:15:00] the ways that we operate treat the city as a person, that's like a process thing. Um, the job of obviously being involved is to do what's best for the city. So we don't have to like worry about, oops, we might accidentally do what's best for ourselves when ourselves is the city.

[00:15:17] **Chris Barhyte:** And I agree. I mean, I agree with that. I know Walton was the same way. They did, they applied all the time to the planning commission and the city staff presented. The city set presented the planning commission, and the planning commission represented the city. So, 

[00:15:30] **Leah Silber:** and the only thing I would say, Alan, is, and I don't, you're not saying this at all, is like, if you thought that, uh, Kelly wasn't doing a good job, or if you had like a problem with their firm or something like that, that's obviously you should bring that up.

[00:15:42] But I don't think that that's what you're asking when you're talking about do we need to like hire somebody to double check them? 

[00:15:47] **Alan Stonewall:** No, I'm, that's, that's not what I'm saying. But, um, I don't wanna get too hung up on this. I, we'll work our way through this, but, uh, there, there is potential conflict for Kelly.

[00:15:58] She can't be reviewing her own [00:16:00] work. The planning commission reviews an application. She submitted the application, we're asking her to review her own work. That's tough. But again, I don't want to be, we'll deal with that later. Yeah. Section 3.070 of the article three of the. Land development ordinance says the commission shall have the powers and duties, which are now or may hereafter be assigned to it by the charter ordinances, resolutions of the city and provisions of this ordinances and the general laws of the state.

[00:16:34] So there in a sentence is what we're supposed to do, but I don't know where in the charter ordinances and repositions of the city are all the issue or the, um, duties, responsibilities, et cetera, assigned to the planning commission. Where do I find where those have been done? And I'm sure they've been done piecemeal over the years, but we don't have a, a table of [00:17:00] contents, for lack of a better word.

[00:17:01] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah. 

[00:17:02] **Alan Stonewall:** What those 

[00:17:03] **Chris Barhyte:** are and, and I will, Alan, I will say that some of that language, the key point is the state law. There is a lot of state law that relates to powers of planning commissions around the state. And how they flow and who appeals what. So there is a lot of, there is a lot of law within the state about the process of an application through the planning commission.

[00:17:24] So maybe we need to get that, but then the charter doesn't really have anything other than saying we can have a planning commission. But it doesn't tell you exactly what you do. I do know that. So yeah, I, I mean it's a fair point. We need to go look at that. I mean, I, and find if there's anything in there, 

[00:17:37] **Leah Silber:** I think it's something we all know we need.

[00:17:38] I think it's something Michael's been here talking about month after month after month. Um, if the planning commission has spare cycles, that's actually a good task for them to poten. Like I know there've been a couple of times where there haven't been items and whatnot, but like that seems like it would be a reasonable task to do, is to work on collating it to help get your own mission [00:18:00] codified in a useful way.

[00:18:01] And I'm not saying it's your job. I'm saying if you have cycles Right. Anybody should try and do it. It's just work that needs to be done. 

[00:18:07] **Doug McLean:** Okay. Well, isn't the original question about enforcement 

[00:18:10] **Leah Silber:** though? 

[00:18:11] **Doug McLean:** No. 

[00:18:11] **Alan Stonewall:** No. No. That's part of it. What enforcement responsibilities do we have? What falls on the council?

[00:18:18] There? There's stuff written and I don't know where it is and it should be applied to what we do. Hopefully we're doing the right things, but I can't say we are. 

[00:18:27] **Leah Silber:** I, I, I wanna say, by the way, I'm not, um, not hearing you and I'm not, not appreciating what you're saying. I just feel like we're all sort of operating in a place of doing the best we can because we are working in a city that hasn't had the funding for a full-time staff or organization or whatnot.

[00:18:43] And so, yes, the answer is yes, you're right about everything and we know you're doing the best you can. And so are all of us. 

[00:18:52] **Doug McLean:** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

[00:18:55] **Chris Barhyte:** All right. So anybody, any other questions for from the Council of Alan? If [00:19:00] not, I'm hearing none. We'll go to standing items. This is the point of the agenda where anyone in the public that would like to talk about a non-ag agenda item.

[00:19:09] You'd raise your hand now. So if there's, I see Michael s Chaz is, if there's anyone else, raise your hand. Um, so we'll move on. Michael s you have three minutes. Name and address for the record. Uh, you're on.

[00:19:26] Oh, he needs to be unmuted. I guess. Analeis, 

[00:19:29] **Michael Salch:** I could say a whole lot about the previous topic and there's a huge amount of responsibility for the planning commission. You, you, you, you don't know where it's at, uh, because it's hard to find anyhow. Um, but now not the time. Um, I wrote sent to you a memo requesting emergency preparedness planning per ordinance 48.

[00:19:55] What are your thoughts about that?[00:20:00] 

[00:20:00] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh, yeah, I mean, we definitely need to do it. We're gonna talk about it at the end of this meeting and probably put and put it on a future meeting. 

[00:20:07] **Michael Salch:** So, yeah. So. So you're gonna put it on, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna move forward on it, right? Yeah. Yes. 

[00:20:16] **Leah Silber:** I mean, 

[00:20:18] **Michael Salch:** it's, it's pretty, I, I don't 

[00:20:18] **Leah Silber:** want, I don't want Chris to say

[00:20:20] it's, sorry. Go ahead, Michael. 

[00:20:22] **Michael Salch:** It's pretty, it's pretty important. Um, there and, and in the flood of 97, we got caught with FEMA with not having any in the flood of nine, pardon me, in the flood of 96, in the flood of 97. We sort of had one. And it's really important because if anything ever happens, that's gonna be one of the earlier questions gonna be asked by FEMA.

[00:20:44] **Leah Silber:** Mm-hmm. Yeah. I guess all, all I wanted to clarify is, uh, I agree that it's important. I think Chris agrees that it's important, the usual asterisk. We have no more staff or people than we had before you reminded us of this legitimately important thing. So [00:21:00] I think Chris is saying yes, but also we'll do the best we can.

[00:21:03] 'cause there's not that much to work with. 

[00:21:04] **Michael Salch:** Okay. The way that way it was done in the past was a city counselor would step up to the action.

[00:21:16] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah. We just say we're gonna put it on the, uh, Jennifer, January as an open item on the, and we can talk about how that, how it looks, what happens, what we do. So, 

[00:21:25] **Michael Salch:** okay. Thank you. 

[00:21:27] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Anybody else, uh, on the, on a non agenda item that wants three minutes to talk? Anybody? Okay. Uh, we are gonna move on to the November minutes.

[00:21:41] We, any motion that were sent out by Bill, so if anybody's had a chance to read them and would like to make a motion, 

[00:21:53] **Doug McLean:** I read them and I'll make a motion. We pass it. 

[00:21:58] **Chris Barhyte:** Any second. [00:22:00] 

[00:22:01] **Analeis Weidlich:** I'll second the motion. 

[00:22:03] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Properly moved and seconded. And we'll go to roll call. 

[00:22:07] **Analeis Weidlich:** Uh, Chris? 

[00:22:10] **Chris Barhyte:** Yes. 

[00:22:11] **Analeis Weidlich:** Rachel Schafer? Yes. Via Cel. 

[00:22:17] Uh, Doug McLean?

[00:22:18] **Doug McLean:** Yes. 

[00:22:19] **Analeis Weidlich:** And Bill Settle? Yes. Okay. Five to zero. The November minutes pass. 

[00:22:25] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. So let's move on to the city financials. The November financials were in the packet. Um, any questions or a motion?

[00:22:41] **Doug McLean:** I'll make a motion that we pass the financials. 

[00:22:45] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh,

[00:22:48] did he, did Bill second that Yes, I think he did. 

[00:22:51] **Bill Tuttle:** No problem. Just add the, the, the words as submitted. 

[00:22:55] **Chris Barhyte:** Oh, as submitted? Yes. Okay. Got it. Um, [00:23:00] uh, vote please. 

[00:23:01] **Analeis Weidlich:** Okay. Uh, Leah Silber, uh, Chris Bhe? 

[00:23:06] **Chris Barhyte:** Yes. 

[00:23:07] **Analeis Weidlich:** Rachel Schafer. 

[00:23:08] **Rachel Schaefer:** Yes. 

[00:23:09] **Analeis Weidlich:** Doug McClain. 

[00:23:11] **Doug McLean:** Yes. 

[00:23:12] **Analeis Weidlich:** Bill Tuttle. Okay. Uh, November minutes as submitted are, uh, approved. Five to zero.

[00:23:21] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Perfect. All right, so we're gonna move on to the existing business. Uh, discuss city planning. So this was a memo put together by Michael s that went to the planning commission, and I think the counselors also got it. Planning commission talked about it. I, I'm not sure what they talked about, so they can maybe update us, but the, and, and the city.

[00:23:41] The city, man. Why don't I let the city manager talk briefly about this and then we'll move to Alan. 

[00:23:45] **Analeis Weidlich:** So, Chris, hold on a second. That's like at the bottom of the agenda. Where are you at here? So we have starting existing business child's road speeding issues. Where, where are you? You're, you're at the, oh no, it, 

[00:23:56] **Chris Barhyte:** uh, remember this got added?

[00:23:58] So if you look at the one Yeah. Its 

[00:23:59] **Analeis Weidlich:** at it's new [00:24:00] business. So it's at the bottom of the agenda. 

[00:24:02] **Chris Barhyte:** Should be, well we added it just to you. I mean, we could move it to the bottom. I just moved to the top because of Alan to let him be done. If you wanted to kind of courtesy to, so if you, if he wanted to leave, he could without sitting through a giant meeting.

[00:24:16] **Analeis Weidlich:** Um, um, 

[00:24:17] **Chris Barhyte:** yeah, so go ahead. 

[00:24:18] **Analeis Weidlich:** Okay. So we have, uh, Michaels notified the city of a, um, an un permitted gate residential front gate in the flood plain in the Floodway 62 10 Southwest Childs Road. Um, there was no permit filed. I've had no call from the residents, uh, who live there, the homeowner, whatever. Um, anyway, so that got brought before the planning commission.

[00:24:41] The conversation then was I've sent a letter to that homeowner actually asking them to contact the city. Reminding them that, you know, the gate or whatever needs to be permitted, not heard a word from them yet. I mean, the letter probably just arrived today and maybe not even today. So, um, hopefully waiting to hear from them is where that [00:25:00] happens.

[00:25:00] So if anybody drives along there, it's a big black, uh, metal gate, uh, with wood slats on it. So, um, anyway, he needs to get a permit for that because he is on a floodplain lot and the floodway, and it's very important in terms of like breakaway materials and other things cut and fill that he'll have to do, he or she, whoever the homeowner is, um, and get it, and get it permitted or have it removed, whatever we gotta do on it.

[00:25:26] So the first step is, is that we have sent a letter and I'm waiting to hear a response, and then we'll have to go from there. 

[00:25:33] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh, so Alan, I know, did you, I don't know what the conversation at the planning commission was about this, but do you have any insight or thoughts from their, from the commission?

[00:25:43] **Alan Stonewall:** Yeah, I do. Um, part of the requirements that we think apply are FEMA rules, and we don't enforce FEMA rules, but I think we require that FEMA compliance be obtained. So we'll have to get some kind of validation that it's been [00:26:00] done, but I don't know what, um, ordinance they're in violation of. 

[00:26:07] **Analeis Weidlich:** Well, so we do enforce FEMA rules because as a city who actually gets flood insurance, like our homeowners, our residents get flood insurance.

[00:26:15] There are certain regulations or requirements for FEMA that are put into the city are flood ordinances, which we have to enforce and maintain. 

[00:26:23] **Alan Stonewall:** Right. But FEMA, so we, so we do, but FEMA will make the ruling, right? No, we 

[00:26:28] **Analeis Weidlich:** do, we do. As a city, we decide that 

[00:26:29] **Alan Stonewall:** they comply with FEMA. 

[00:26:31] **Analeis Weidlich:** Yes. It's our flood ordinances, which, which are, that come from the regulations from FEMA, our requirements.

[00:26:37] And so we have to enforce our own floodplain ordinances. And our standards have to meet FEMA or higher. 

[00:26:45] **Alan Stonewall:** Does that landowner have to get a FEMA permit? 

[00:26:48] **Analeis Weidlich:** No. 

[00:26:50] **Alan Stonewall:** So FEMA's not gonna enforce their own rules? 

[00:26:53] **Analeis Weidlich:** Well, no, because the city of Rivergrove enforces the FEMA re floodplain regulations. That's how it works.[00:27:00] 

[00:27:01] **Alan Stonewall:** I'm confused. We're not engineers. How do we know they comply? 

[00:27:08] **Chris Barhyte:** That's why we use our 

[00:27:09] **Analeis Weidlich:** city engineer. That's, we have a contract city engineer and a contract planner who know those rules and regulations, and they're in our floodplain ordinances.

[00:27:19] **Bill Tuttle:** Okay. 

[00:27:21] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh, Leah, 

[00:27:25] **Leah Silber:** uh, suggestion? Um. It might be good to write a letter. Us as the city, if there's no like legal reason that we can't, to the vendors that we know are like the number one vendors in our areas doing this kind of work. Just saying, Hey, there are rules. You need to talk to us. Your homeowners need to come talk to the city.

[00:27:47] Because when I looked into putting up my fence, I've got four different quotes and all of them were like, you don't need any permits. What does the floodplain have to do with anything? And like, I only remember Rick's name from it because they're like the 8,000 pound [00:28:00] gorilla in the industry. But everybody I talked to, and we have the same problem with tree trimmers, right?

[00:28:05] Like so we might want want with arborists. I mean we might just wanna save ourselves some headache and send out 15 letters saying like, by the way, hi, we're the city. Just so you know, we exist and we have rules. 

[00:28:15] **Analeis Weidlich:** Uh. Here, here's what I would probably say is there's probably a gazillion people from little, like one of people, one of guys, you know, that do fence.

[00:28:23] Yeah. You know, handyman who go, oh, I can put up a gate. Oh, I can put up a fence. You know, to some of the bigger companies, I mean, what I would really like to do actually, and we don't have all of it, is there's a lot of people who belong to the city newsletter, right? So they get information on the city newsletter, but it would be really our 550 residents or however many actual homes or properties, I don't know what the number of properties is actually somehow get them.

[00:28:47] Whether it's by mail and notification of, hey, you know, if these are the rules that we need to follow, if the tree permits, you have to get a tree permit. If you need to get a, uh, permit from the planning commission, this is what you need to [00:29:00] have. I think we just need to educate our own citizens and residents of what actually is required on permitting.

[00:29:07] Um, because there could be a whole bunch of tree companies, a whole bunch of fence companies, and we're just stabbing needles in the dark. I mean. I, I don't think I've actually had the same tree company come and get a permit from me and how many tree permits have we done? Right? There's just a lot of 'em.

[00:29:21] So that's a lot of extra work to try and find who are those tree companies or who are the fence companies. 

[00:29:26] **Leah Silber:** Oh, I agree. Great idea. I think it could So mailing to everybody. Absolutely. Like that's an even better idea. And also if we just whip up like a template, every time that we run into somebody, we just fire off a letter in the post for a buck or whatever, you know, and we won't hit them all, but we'll probably save ourselves some headaches.

[00:29:43] I think we should do both, is the answer. Right? 

[00:29:47] **Chris Barhyte:** Well, and and on another note, gates are an interesting, gates are an interesting feature because we as a city, because you're doing cut and fill in the flood point. So to Alan's point on permitting, that's, so that's one of the big issues. Cut and fill. You're [00:30:00] putting post in, there's fill issues with a post offsetting water.

[00:30:03] Then the other side of that is. Um, another big part of this is you're putting a fence on Clackamas County Road, so they need the opportunity to see are you in the right of way with your fence. As you know, that road kicks over in several spots. So there's, there's significant right of way in some spots, so you could be putting a fence on the county's right of the counties right away.

[00:30:26] So that has to be dealt within the permit. Um, and then like, I guess in this one, when I read it, it looks like they had the electrical work done. So I'm assuming they would've had to have somebody do the electrical work. We don't permit the electrical work, but they would have to get that from, uh, from the county.

[00:30:43] Um, so I guess the question here is how do we, what do we do with these things? Because right now what I hear happen is that we see a violation. Now I don't want to, I think we need to come and let them cure the violation. I think that's important. I. Like, how [00:31:00] do you cure the violation that you did? You maybe you didn't know.

[00:31:03] Right? So I, I do think that, but then if they don't cure the violation, where are the teeth that the city has for not curing the violation? That's kind of the question we have. And we've had that same issue happen on another project that, you know, we sent a letter and said you have to move it, but then it's, we can give a, we can give a little bit of a fine, but, um, maybe that's not enough to, for people to care.

[00:31:28] **Leah Silber:** I would say that this is even a little bit more extreme than that because everybody else who lives here doesn't know what's going on with the example that you cited. But this one's like very noticeable and everybody who drives down the road is like, oh look, those guys got a new gate. Uh, so if we want to have teeth in the future, this is in fact the case where we have to figure out what they are and do something with them.

[00:31:50] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah, I mean, that's what we're here. So, I mean, the planning commission, it sounds like it said you, you need to have some teeth. But then they kick, the council has to [00:32:00] pass an ordinance. We would write an ordinance and then send it back to the planning commission to review that ordinance. So they would get a look at it and they would've to pass it outta their com, you know, out of their body.

[00:32:11] **Leah Silber:** But the ordinance that you are talking about is just to say, these are the enforcement mechanisms. 'cause the rules, we already know roughly what they are and that they've been violated. Yes. 

[00:32:19] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah. This would be the, like what do we do as a city? When someone violates a rule, what is the process for that? Is that right?

[00:32:28] Analeis? 

[00:32:29] **Analeis Weidlich:** Uh, yeah. I mean I think that that's was kind of ultimately what the planning commission said is like, okay, so what's the step by step? What's the process? You know, at this point, obviously we're allowing these people to hopefully cure getting a building per, or not a building permit, a, a permit from the city of Rivergrove, a development permit.

[00:32:45] Um, but what happens if they don't? Right? Like what's step number two and what goes down from there and what legal teeth do we have after that if they don't get the permit? And how does that work? 

[00:32:56] **Leah Silber:** But when you say if they get a permit, like that is not [00:33:00] something that would be permitted as is. So they they won't get it.

[00:33:02] Right because, oh, 

[00:33:03] **Analeis Weidlich:** because they're in the flood plain. Right. So because they're in the flood plain, there's all those additional flood ordinances that they have to adhere to, including the structure and what the materials that it's made from, which is in our code. Yeah. 

[00:33:17] **Leah Silber:** So it's, I'm just saying it's not as simple as, oh, you missed an application apply.

[00:33:21] Oh, no. Agreed at It's like you installed something that we don't allow. You need to fix it and change it or whatever. Well, it's not that 

[00:33:26] **Analeis Weidlich:** it's, it's not that we don't allow it, it's just that it has to be met to specs. Right. I mean, it, it needs to go through our land development process. You're just 

[00:33:33] **Leah Silber:** saying it might be to spec We, we just don't know.

[00:33:37] **Analeis Weidlich:** Right. I, I mean, I, I, I, looking at it, I don't think it is, but we, he's got whoever he or she needs to apply so that we can go through the process with them. 

[00:33:45] **Chris Barhyte:** Well, and we have two ways to do things. Right. You can do it right away and just say, Hey, you violated, here's your fine. Or we can give him a cure period.

[00:33:51] In my, you know, in my mind we give 'em a cure period and say, Hey. You didn't know that was supposed to happen. You need to file for a [00:34:00] plan. You need to do the process to get it happen. You may have to alter the structure during that permit process, but no harm, no foul right now. But if they basically say, look, bummer for you guys, it's staying at what you know.

[00:34:13] So what happens then? And that ordinance probably would talk about here's what, here's how we would handle the first letter that would be in the ordinance. And then here's what happens if you don't deal with it in the second part of the ordinance. 

[00:34:26] **Analeis Weidlich:** I, I, I think that like the bigger issue that at least I see from people calling me, right?

[00:34:30] 'cause I get a lot of phone calls from people asking about permits is. There is a real disconnect of people who now live in the floodplain, right? Or say they've been here for 30 years, or they just bought a house two months ago, right? In the floodplain, there is a disconnect of the reality of the responsibility of having a property in the floodplain, and what does that mean, and what do you have to do?

[00:34:53] Or what can you do, or what can you not do? How much of those FEMA regulations are now in the floodplain [00:35:00] ordinances? Like what are the requirements? There's just, you know, I, I kind of just go round and round with a lot of people on the phone because they're like, well, what do you mean? Like, why, why can't I just put up a fence?

[00:35:09] And I'm like, well, because you live on the river. You're in the floodplain. Oh, and by the way, you're on the floodway, you know? And so there's certain requirements for that. So it's just we really need to start educating. The citizens of Rivergrove are the homeowners here, which is, you know, it's not a simple thing to just have a beautiful lot on the river.

[00:35:27] There's a lot of responsibility that comes with that. So I think that's step number one, which is kind of enforcement, but kind of not, is that people just don't get it. They just don't get the regulations of living on the river. 

[00:35:38] **Leah Silber:** It's a similar education opportunity as needing to send letters to all our people.

[00:35:43] Um, the only thing that, like when I bought my house, I think the day that the property changed hands, somebody showed up and Scotch taped a letter to my front door that was like, hi, welcome. We're the Rivergrove Water District and you need to pay us money right now, $50 deposit or whatever. We're, we're gonna turn [00:36:00] off your water right.

[00:36:02] So there is a process and the water company is in the communication of, hey somebody, some property just changed hands and we need to get, we need to get ourselves into that funnel. So we also go and stick something on a door, right? And unlike that sounds like work that people need to do, but also there's like 500 homes or something.

[00:36:18] We could probably do that. We could probably go stick something on the neighborhood on a door when property change hands. And that's a 

[00:36:23] **Analeis Weidlich:** good point is like, you know, is there a way that I can get notified when you know there's a change? Um, you know, water district, we can stick guard letter on there, call us, don't do anything to your mouse.

[00:36:32] **Leah Silber:** Yes. So I think that's actually, that's a good task. Like let's ask the water district, where's that communication come from? If we don't know and let's do it. 

[00:36:39] **Analeis Weidlich:** But there's a lot of headaches, right, that are created. There's a lot of extra work for me 'cause I have to get, trying to get people compliant. Like, well no, I'm sorry you can't down 10 trees.

[00:36:47] You know, that's not okay. 

[00:36:49] **Chris Barhyte:** So I mean, just to kind of move this along. So it sounds like we all think something needs to happen here. Do we need to reach out to other cities and see what other cities are doing with [00:37:00] compliance issues? Um, I mean, I don't know what it looks like 'cause I don't know what other cities are doing in compliance.

[00:37:05] So I guess how do we move it? If the council's interested in doing this, then I think we ask the city manager maybe, or someone just to find out okay, what, like what are the four cities in the metro area that we could look at Nearest that are, what are, what do they do for this if you do something well, 

[00:37:20] **Analeis Weidlich:** and I, I think what you need to do though is not necessarily cities around us, but cities of our similar size.

[00:37:26] Right, okay. 

[00:37:26] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah. 

[00:37:27] **Analeis Weidlich:** Same mechanism for the lack of mechanisms. Right. We don't have a circuit court, we don't have, you know, we don't have a running hot and cold city attorney that's, you know, that, that's on staff, you know? So how does that look for another similar jurisdiction like the city of Durham maybe is a good one to look at.

[00:37:41] Yeah. You know, cities that are 

[00:37:42] of similar size, like what do they do to do code enforcement? 

[00:37:46] **Leah Silber:** I would, um, I would suggest for short term looking at like, oh, just 'cause it's right here and so many of our new residents are gonna be having moved in from there and so mm-hmm. The things that they do, they won't all be accessible to us, but we can take some less, we can take some.

[00:37:59] Uh, [00:38:00] lessons from them and figure out like what they do. But also if you look at the list of cities on the metro, the MACC Council, that's like probably a reasonable list of 15 cities that are the, are similar-ish sizes to us in some ways. And those would, that would be a good list of people to try and call or get relationships with.

[00:38:18] **Analeis Weidlich:** Right. Yeah. 'cause I think it's, it's a size issue and it's a financial, yeah. Like what, what would, can we or not do you know, what can we do or not do? Yeah. And 

[00:38:25] **Leah Silber:** then obviously like we can find population similar cities, but if they have a tax base, it's a whole different ball game anyway, so yeah. We'll have to figure it out.

[00:38:34] **Alan Stonewall:** What is the council's understanding as to the planning commission's responsibility with this application? At this point, there's no application. I shouldn't say that. This potential violation. 

[00:38:46] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah, there's, I mean, I don't think there's anything you can do. And I don't even think there's really, I mean we can send 'em a letter, but I don't think the planning commission has a process until they try to cure this.

[00:38:56] That would go to you. So when that [00:39:00] homeowner, when that homeowner files the application, that will go through your body and you'll review that. Uh, the reason I think, yeah, go ahead. 

[00:39:10] **Analeis Weidlich:** Yeah. My hope is, is that they'll, they'll reach out to me, you know, we'll have to rewind a little bit and get them, get, get an application submitted and then it just goes through the normal process, you know, and if this doesn't happen, then we'll just have to cross this bridge as to what do we do now.

[00:39:24] **Doug McLean:** Okay. So we don't need to be, uh, going and trying to re, you know, going and establishing all this stuff ahead of time. Let's just send 'em a nice, friendly letter and talk to 'em to start with. 

[00:39:33] **Leah Silber:** I think Analeis has already done, yeah. 

[00:39:36] **Alan Stonewall:** My question is who, who sends the letter and I think it is the city and the city council.

[00:39:39] So we're all city. Yes. City manager, city. We all agree on 

[00:39:42] that? 

[00:39:43] **Doug McLean:** Yep. That's all we gotta do right now. 

[00:39:47] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. So what we're gonna do is we're just gonna go back and research similar North Plains, Durham, lake Oswego, and see what other cities are doing just to see what they're doing. I mean, I. So I guess, I know Doug's shaking his head, but I mean, [00:40:00] our issue is, is how do we deal with non cured, um, 

[00:40:06] problems?

[00:40:06] **Analeis Weidlich:** I think it's to be determined. I think we need to, you know, we need to do some more research, could do some more data collection and you know, it needs to get on it the next agenda, I mean the next month we can add it on as another agenda item. 

[00:40:19] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Alright. Well this, I mean more debt. We're not making a decision tonight, but, okay.

[00:40:23] Let's move on to child speeding issue. Anybody that we don't have anything to talk about, but it is on the agenda. So is there anybody that would like to talk about this topic? Any, anyone from the public? If you'd like to, you can raise your hand.

[00:40:41] Okay. I'm moving on. So basically where we're at on that, just so everybody, oh, Michael Salch Yes. Three minutes.

[00:40:50] I guess he has to be unmuted, I think. I think Analeis is doing that. 

[00:40:56] **Doug McLean:** Hmm.

[00:40:59] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay, [00:41:00] you're up. 

[00:41:00] **Michael Salch:** So, so what I, I missed the topic. What's the topic? 

[00:41:04] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh, child road speeding issues, which is the topic that was on where we voted on several solutions at the last meeting to purchase at the county. 

[00:41:14] **Michael Salch:** Yeah. And the, and the la by the way, there's, there's a document I sent to the city a couple years ago about the missing a DA ramps on childs, and that's county's responsibility.

[00:41:31] And it would really be nice if the city council would be willing to support that and get something done. At least go to the county and ask 'em what they're gonna do about it, because that's a federal code. And in fact, right in front of my house is when I watch. Seniors, older people, um, step down that curbing, step up that curbing frequently.

[00:41:53] The other thing is, is in reference to what I heard before, the rather involved traffic [00:42:00] pattern studies of 2016 to 2020. Um, when there's construction at Stafford and Childs, the traffic flow will be less. However, based upon the projections of traffic patterns after the roundabout, uh, there'll be quite a bit more cut through traffic.

[00:42:25] So, um, that was pretty, pretty well involved and pretty well endorsed by Lake Oswego Traffic People Engineering. Uh, they agreed and, um, long time ago I also went to the county. So there's a lot of information on that. Thank you. 

[00:42:44] **Chris Barhyte:** So where we're at is we're really waiting for, uh, the city or the county traffic planner to do some work.

[00:42:51] And Analeis, do you just wanna run through what the issue on that is really quick? 

[00:42:54] **Analeis Weidlich:** You mean like where he is? 

[00:42:56] **Chris Barhyte:** Well, just that he's unavailable until after the first year. Right. So 

[00:42:59] **Analeis Weidlich:** the, so [00:43:00] the traffic engineer for Clackamas County who is going to be doing our engineering work for us, that's the contribution from Clackamas County.

[00:43:07] He's currently serving on a grand jury till, at least early December, uh, early January, maybe longer. So he is literally out of commission right now. So we just have to be patient. You know, I, he kind of went MIA on me a little bit and then I finally got an email response back from him, but that's where he is.

[00:43:23] So, um, we can, we're kind of on a holding pattern waiting for him to get back and I'm sure he's gonna be slammed with a lot of stuff. 

[00:43:32] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah. So we're just really waiting for him to, because we can't do any of the install without the formal engineering document from Clackamas County. So we've already funded it.

[00:43:41] We're just waiting for them to give us the formal engineering. 

[00:43:43] **Analeis Weidlich:** He was working on that, and then he got called to this grand jury, which I didn't realize was a very long process. 

[00:43:50] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay, so, uh, that's it on that the start boat ramp, neighboring property drainage on city property will be the topic. [00:44:00] Anybody from the public, uh, like to speak on this, please raise your hand.

[00:44:04] You'll have three minutes. Anybody. Okay, so I don't see anybody. So we're gonna move on just to a SA small report on this. So when we do the planning for the boat ramp, we're gonna throw that drainage in there because obviously there's gonna be some changes to the slope, or we're gonna have to do some stuff with landscaping and things not change to the slope.

[00:44:28] Wrong language, I don't want anyone to hang on that. But, uh, just landscaping. And so, uh, when we do that, we're just going to, we're gonna put this drainage issue in that. Project to see how we fix it. The current landowner is, is uh, has an attorney who's saying that, that the natural drainage for that property is on the boat ramp.

[00:44:51] So, um, we're just gonna wait until we get all the topography to figure that out and how we can solve it. So we're just putting that on hold [00:45:00] and that's where we're at. So when we go through the planning for the boat ramp, um, okay. I have four, oh, go ahead. Question. Yes. 

[00:45:08] **Doug McLean:** Are we, are we gonna rescind then that, uh, the requirement to remove those, uh, drains then that we sent out before?

[00:45:18] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah, we were just gonna send a letter just extending their deadline until, uh, March for now until we can get through some plan. 'cause by then it'll go to the planning commission, all that. So. Okay. 

[00:45:33] **Bill Tuttle:** Is there any way we can get a hold of a, uh. Uh, a map that shows the elevations of the property before the house was built.

[00:45:46] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh, we we're, we are going to look for the files in our, in our, uh, grade, um, shed that we have that has all the documents. So there is a chance that we'll find the [00:46:00] topography of that site prior. We don't have that yet. So what we'll do is we'll just forward that on to the boom as we're going through the plan.

[00:46:07] **Bill Tuttle:** That's a very good question. That was my point last month was it's not that, oh, those drains were there and they were permitted. It's where would the water go if the house wasn't there? And you're correct. Doesn't go the boat ramp. 

[00:46:22] **Doug McLean:** No, it wouldn't go down the boat ramp. 

[00:46:24] **Bill Tuttle:** Well, we don't know, but probably not.

[00:46:28] **Chris Barhyte:** Yes, agreed. So we're just gonna wait until we have, uh, some engineering work to show that. But I, I, yeah, I mean, that's where we're at. So, okay, so now we're going to the FEMA new Special Flood Hazard Rules Subcommittee, which I believe would be, uh, councilor Tuttle. You're up 

[00:46:51] **Bill Tuttle:** End city manager. I'm, I'm shuffling papers to make notes.

[00:46:55] Um, uh, we talked [00:47:00] briefly at the planning commission meeting about it. So, uh, I believe the city manager has sent a note to, I don't know, was this FEMA or somebody saying, of the three options we are going to rewrite our floodplain ordinance. Uh, I did a quick markup of the draft thing, uh, ordinance and, uh, we'll have to, you know, just continue with that.

[00:47:28] Uh, I would guess I. That if we just accept the draft ordinance and put in what pertains to our city, like, you know, instead of it has something that says City and we need to put in Rivergrove, that would be sufficient. But I think we want to take a look at it and, uh, modify it to, as we see fit. And then, uh, Elise can correct me.[00:48:00] 

[00:48:00] We may need to send it to somebody to make sure that it meets FEMA requirements. 

[00:48:07] **Analeis Weidlich:** Well, so what I wanna do is after you get done with your thing, um, you know, taking the model code and plugging in our, you know, whatever and taking out, what we don't want is send it first to Kelly, Grover, our city engineer, 'cause she's worked with our code enough and she's the one that processes all those applications to make sure, you know, just from her level as a city.

[00:48:26] That we're in the right direction and then Correct. I can then send that document to DCLD. They have a technical review team that they can review it actually and give us feedback at that point. So, and then we can start our public process and, and through that public process, we'll maybe make changes. I mean, that's why you have public process.

[00:48:42] I, 

[00:48:45] **Bill Tuttle:** the one thing, and I don't know how the council feels about it, but, uh, I think we have a little leeway on how high above the floodplain we want houses to be constructed. [00:49:00] It has to be at least one foot, could be two, three, 

[00:49:04] **Analeis Weidlich:** I think it has to be three feet now, base flood elevation plus three feet, and like Washington County for example, they won't even approve anything unless it's at least three feet or higher.

[00:49:16] **Doug McLean:** Wow. That's 

[00:49:19] **Bill Tuttle:** only for Bill. We have a problem with it. We just, maybe I'll just put in two feet and we'll let people discuss it. 

[00:49:27] **Analeis Weidlich:** Right. 

[00:49:28] **Bill Tuttle:** With the caveat that it had, that's the minimum. 

[00:49:31] **Analeis Weidlich:** Well, and that's why I wanted Kelly to review it too, just because she knows between Clackamas and Washington and what's that standard and you know, we don't wanna approve a permit and then someone gets to the county and they go, well, sorry.

[00:49:42] You know, I mean it's fine. It meets Rivergrove standards, but Clackamas County or Washington County standards are X and you gotta do this. Right. I mean, there's no sense making homeowners go through that.

[00:49:55] **Doug McLean:** Is it just houses or is it other things too? [00:50:00] 

[00:50:02] **Analeis Weidlich:** I think that's habitable structures. I, I, I believe I, you know, I don't know. I'm not very well versed in floodplain this stuff, so that's why I have to lean on Kelly on a lot of this, because she knows. Well, 

[00:50:14] **Chris Barhyte:** and, and I do know this, like a garage can be below that.

[00:50:17] It's the living space. 

[00:50:20] **Analeis Weidlich:** The living space, right. Not habitable, but living spaces. Right. 

[00:50:23] **Bill Tuttle:** Okay. So a gazebo would be an exception. I mean, you wouldn't have to build it, although there would be issues with displacement of water or in a floodway, it is 

[00:50:36] **Leah Silber:** under 200 square feet I think it is. Right. 

[00:50:41] **Analeis Weidlich:** Uh, see, I don't know.

[00:50:42] Those are really good questions. Now with the FEMA thing, that's why I just, let's, let's take the model code, let's plug in, you know, our city information that we know and then let's get it to Kelly. 'cause she's also done some of the, you know, gone to some of the, I dunno if you call it the webinars or whatever, the technical things.

[00:50:58] And she has a better [00:51:00] handle on what it is we need and don't need.

[00:51:06] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Any other questions on this? Alan, did you have anything you wanted to say on it? 

[00:51:11] **Alan Stonewall:** No, we're just, um, babes in the woods on this one. We'll, we'll have to worry about some of those enforcing compliance down the road, but until we know what's there, um, we don't know if we're gonna need a whole lot of help understanding what we're enforcing or not.

[00:51:31] **Doug McLean:** Okay. Was Analeis, were you going to some of those meetings also, or, 

[00:51:36] **Analeis Weidlich:** yeah. Yeah, so I, I did go to, um, FEMA rolled out a whole bunch of 'em to begin with actually, that went through all the different regulations, I mean, at a very high level, um, and the different things. But then there's like engineering spec type ones, and Kelly, um, not necessarily on behalf of the city of River Girl, but just because of her job, she's gone to a couple of those to understand the engineering change with changes, with the floodplains and structure [00:52:00] changes.

[00:52:01] **Doug McLean:** Okay. Yeah.

[00:52:07] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh, okay. So let's move on to, uh, agenda item five. So anybody on the metro local shared grant from the public that would like to, uh, make comment for three minutes. Uh, if you have, you can wave in front of your screen or put your hand up. So is there anyone on this topic from the public? Okay, so the Metro Local Share Grant, the, it's in the packet.

[00:52:35] Um, basically it's our share of some local tax dollars that passed in 2009. It's sent out to jurisdictions based on population. Uh, this is our portion of that. So we submitted to do the Boat Ramp project with it. And so that's what you see is the, so what we're recommending is that we authorize the city manager to sign the document on behalf of the City [00:53:00] of Rivergrove.

[00:53:01] Um. And so that's what the discussion is. So, uh, Councillor Tuttle, 

[00:53:08] **Bill Tuttle:** as the city attorney signed it, I assume it's probably a pretty standard type of agreement. I don't know if we need to run it by the city attorney or not.

[00:53:22] **Doug McLean:** I don't think so. 

[00:53:23] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh, we, I mean, we haven't just because, uh, I mean, our theory is that metro we, I, I mean, I read it, I've read it. It doesn't seem to, I mean, if people think we should, we could, but it just costs money. I mean, 

[00:53:35] **Analeis Weidlich:** it's the same IGA that every city gets and the Metro Attorney team, which is vast, right?

[00:53:41] I mean, they have a lot of attorneys for metro. They're the ones that generate it. So I think that even if we had a disagreement or we said, well, we want you to do add this, it, or that in Metro would say, well, this is the legal IGA that we use. And every city signs it, so either sign it or don't sign it. Um, [00:54:00] it's just, I think it's their template signature or their, you know, IGA that they use, that metros use forever and ever and ever.

[00:54:08] **Bill Tuttle:** I was just raising the question for the council, therefore I No, I just wanted to let 

[00:54:11] **Analeis Weidlich:** you know that. Right, that's 'cause I asked that too. Is this like, is this something specific to Rivergrove and it's like, no, that is just their IGA that they use for all of the local share grants monies. 

[00:54:22] **Bill Tuttle:** I mean, it's fair.

[00:54:23] All right. I move, we have the city manager, uh, sign it and send it back. 

[00:54:30] **Chris Barhyte:** I second. Anybody 

[00:54:30] **Bill Tuttle:** wanna 

[00:54:31] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Uh, probably moved in. Seconded, uh, roll call. 

[00:54:34] **Analeis Weidlich:** Okay. Chris Barhyte? 

[00:54:36] **Chris Barhyte:** Uh, yes. 

[00:54:37] **Analeis Weidlich:** Doug Cle? 

[00:54:38] **Chris Barhyte:** Yes. 

[00:54:39] Uh, Leah Silber. Rachel Schafer? 

[00:54:43] **Rachel Schaefer:** Yes. 

[00:54:44] **Analeis Weidlich:** And Bill Tuttle? 

[00:54:46] **Bill Tuttle:** Yes. 

[00:54:47] **Analeis Weidlich:** Okay. Uh, the draft motion or the motion to have me sign the IGA when it's available for Metro local share passes?

[00:54:54] Five to zero.

[00:54:58] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Let's [00:55:00] move on to item six, the update on the Stark Boat Ramp Violation project. Revitalization project. Uh, the goal is to submit to the planning commission on February at the February meeting, but is there anybody from the public that would like to talk? Uh, you have three minutes. Name and address.

[00:55:17] You can raise your hand or wave in front of your screen. Your choice. Anybody? Okay. So, uh, hearing none, we'll move on. So this will be. The, we will give this to the planning commission and then they will review the plan In the packet is basically, well, not basically, it's the, it's the plan that we passed at a city council meeting, um, before it's actually in the back of the grant document, but it has, it's also in here.

[00:55:48] So this was the Star boat ramp. It's one of the attachments. That's what we already voted on. I think it was at the April May meeting. So nothing's changed on that. So that's what will be taken, revised and given [00:56:00] to the planning commission for permit. And then that permit once, once it's gone there, if it's, if it needs to change whatever, then we go to the other government agencies for permitting.

[00:56:10] So, all right. Uh, item seven is the City of Rivergrove Development Code revision. Uh, anybody from the public that would like to take three minutes and talk about this particular item now would be your time. So I hear no one from the public or see no one. So move on to Councilor Tuttle for a report.

[00:56:34] **Bill Tuttle:** I think we need to put that, uh, wherever we had for future items to consider, because the floodplain ordinance takes precedence. 

[00:56:48] **Chris Barhyte:** Do you just want me to leave it as a standing item, or do you just want me to move it all the way? Do you want to leave it as a standing item that just so it's there, or do you wanna move it down to a future, future meeting item?

[00:56:58] We could do that too. I would 

[00:56:59] **Bill Tuttle:** move it to future [00:57:00] meeting items. Okay. Because we're not gonna be 

[00:57:02] **Chris Barhyte:** able to do anything with it for a while. Okay. So it'll get just moved down. Okay. So the next thing would be the election certified that came in from the counties. Uh, anybody from the public that would like to talk on this agenda item can raise your hand.

[00:57:19] Okay. So the in the packet is just the certified election results. From the county. I don't know. Do we need to vote that we accept the results as a we as a council? I actually don't know that answer. I mean, I guess it wouldn't hurt, I suppose, right? 

[00:57:36] **Speaker:** Yeah. 

[00:57:38] **Chris Barhyte:** I mean, all we'd be doing is making a motion to accept the county certified election results for the November 5th election.

[00:57:46] I don't know if that, I mean, I guess we do it just in case someone says we didn't do it. Does anybody wanna make that motion or, so moved? So moved. Alright. [00:58:00] Uh, second. Anybody? 

[00:58:03] **Analeis Weidlich:** I'll second that. 

[00:58:05] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Um, all in, uh, we'll do a roll call. 

[00:58:10] **Analeis Weidlich:** Okay. Bill Tuttle to accept the election results.

[00:58:17] Yes. Okay. Rachel Schaefer? 

[00:58:19] **Rachel Schaefer:** Yes. 

[00:58:19] **Analeis Weidlich:** Leah Silber. Uh. Doug McLean? 

[00:58:24] **Doug McLean:** Yes. 

[00:58:24] Chris Barhyte? 

[00:58:26] **Analeis Weidlich:** Yes. Okay. 

[00:58:27] I'm just, uh, 

[00:58:28] **Chris Barhyte:** the next item is the park committee. Anybody that we've scheduled the meeting for Wednesday the 15th, it's on the calendar for the city. Uh, we need to notify the, the folks that are on the committee, but it'll be on the 15th.

[00:58:39] I think that's a Wednesday at seven via Zoom. Um, so does anybody have any comments on that? 

[00:58:46] **Leah Silber:** I have a question. How did we choose a time if the people on the committee didn't tell us that it worked for them? 

[00:58:52] **Chris Barhyte:** You know, that's a good question. In my experience, instead of doing a Google thing, we're gonna try 

[00:58:56] **Leah Silber:** with, start with something, we're just 

[00:58:57] **Chris Barhyte:** gonna put it, we're just gonna put a date out there [00:59:00] and give it to 'em a month out.

[00:59:01] And, I mean, we had seven, there's gonna be eight people. I hope they're all 

[00:59:06] **Leah Silber:** still there, basically. 'cause it's been a while since we started collecting humans. 

[00:59:10] **Chris Barhyte:** Well, they've been email, we've had emails, discussions, some people have been emailing, asking about, so we know they're still in the city, so that's good.

[00:59:17] Uh, okay. Who on the, 

[00:59:20] **Doug McLean:** who on the city council is on that? 

[00:59:24] **Chris Barhyte:** We don't, we can put a city council on it. I, I mean, I'm just gonna do the kickoff call, but it would technically it would be you, Doug. 'cause you're the park guy, so you'd be the one to be on it as our park representative. So hopefully the 15th works for you at seven.

[00:59:36] So we're trying it right now, 

[00:59:39] **Doug McLean:** but I've not, I've just not gotten any information. 

[00:59:42] **Chris Barhyte:** No, no, no one has, I just threw it out here as a date just because I had heard that we need to do it and I'm like, let's just get a date. Put it on there. So put that on your calendar. The 15th. There's a, there's a link on the site.

[00:59:52] It's already on our city calendar. So, uh, okay. So new business [01:00:00] council fu is there anything people want added to the, to a future meeting? Any counselors have any items they'd like to see at a future meeting? Leah, 

[01:00:08] maybe. 

[01:00:09] **Leah Silber:** Um, Analeis is the, uh, hazard Mitigation Grant program from FEMA. On your radar. 'cause they just announced a whole bunch of new funding and some of it doesn't really apply to us, but one of the items is just like severe winter storms, which obviously happen.

[01:00:27] Um, and there's like $13 million up for grabs. Is that on your, uh, you know, I saw 

[01:00:34] **Analeis Weidlich:** an, I saw an email that came through and glanced at it, and I kind of came to the conclusion like, I don't know if we would qualify. I mean, a lot of that was for like, shelters, warming, shelters, you know, equipment, you know, so I kind of had this thing of like, what would we do, you know, we don't even have city hall, we don't even have storage.

[01:00:51] So yeah, I, I, I did see that it just came through, but I literally haven't done anything with it, you know, in the, yeah. As you understand, in my giant list of stuff that [01:01:00] I'm the only sole person doing. Yes. I kind of totally like, I don't know, I, I, I don't know. I kind of just passed on. 

[01:01:07] **Leah Silber:** It could be that some of the stuff in there would be eligible for helping us establish and sort out like some of the stuff that Michael is bringing up in the disaster relief stuff.

[01:01:17] And, um, I will say that like, uh, when I was on the Bryant Neighborhood Association, we applied for certain, like grants like this from Lake Oswego and whatnot, and we didn't have any structure. What we had was Lakeridge Middle School, let us put like a outdoor little tiny shed on their property. And once we had that, we were able to apply for grants to get funding and like stock it up every year as we got more grants.

[01:01:43] And there's no reason we couldn't do something like that. 

[01:01:46] **Analeis Weidlich:** Right. 

[01:01:46] **Leah Silber:** Either. Uh, like we, and we, we have actually property, so we could put it in one of the parks or something in a back corner. Right. We could make a small shed or even get someone to let us put it on their property. So I would say that even though we don't have, or, or maybe the grant is.

[01:01:59] To [01:02:00] actually make something. Right? Because I, I think portions of it specify it has to be like capital, uh, expenditures, ands probably what, yeah, because what I can again it, 

[01:02:06] **Analeis Weidlich:** like glance through it, you know, I mean, I get a lot of emails every day, so when I kind of glance Yes, I'm sure I was like, uh, there's just most of the emails that come through on federal funding dollars we don't qualify for.

[01:02:17] Um, there's always some caveat that it's like, oh, that's not us. Okay. Delete onto the next one. 

[01:02:21] **Leah Silber:** Yeah, totally. The, so there is a meeting this week that if it works for your schedule, it's probably the Right, it's like December 12th or 13th or something. It's probably the opportunity to learn about it.

[01:02:31] **Analeis Weidlich:** Mm-hmm. 

[01:02:31] **Leah Silber:** Um, but the, the thing that made me think, I'm not sure if we would qualify is that we have to have a, I noted this somewhere, a specific kind of, um, FEMA approved policy, which. Either could be a thing that we could get approval for, or it's plausible that one of the ordinances that Michael sent us already qualifies technically from the beginning of time, right?

[01:02:53] Mm-hmm. Um, so like there's a box that we would have to make sure we tick before we could apply, but it might be, it might be an opportunity for us to [01:03:00] start out our stash of disaster relief type of investments. 

[01:03:04] **Analeis Weidlich:** Right. Okay, good. I'll take a, I'll take another look at that email. 'cause I think there was a link where you could go to the website and, you know, read all this stuff.

[01:03:09] **Leah Silber:** Yeah, it is, it does seem to be turning around pretty quickly. So like, there's like an applications are open in a couple of weeks and they're only open for like, a little bit, and then they decide in like a week. So the whole thing will be fairly quick. Um, which also, by the way, tells me a lot of people will not bother because they can't turn it around quickly.

[01:03:26] So it's worth looking at. 'cause there might be a opportunity. Right. And actually 

[01:03:29] **Analeis Weidlich:** that's a, that's a good thing for a small city like ours is because we can typically turn things around fairly quickly. We don't have a big bureaucracy. We may not have a lot of bureaucracy, but we don't have a big one. 

[01:03:39] **Chris Barhyte:** Cool.

[01:03:40] Well, I'll put that on. 'cause right now we added emergency preparedness. Yeah. We could lump those 

[01:03:44] **Leah Silber:** together. I just didn't remember it until now. Yeah. 

[01:03:46] **Chris Barhyte:** So I'll, I'll lump that one in there. Anything else that people want for a future meeting

[01:03:54] thing? Doug? 

[01:03:56] **Doug McLean:** Donuts. 

[01:03:57] **Chris Barhyte:** Donuts. Oh, uh, [01:04:00] I know that is one thing. I know Leah was gonna, I'd mentioned it to her. I don't know when you're in your meeting with Mac Metropolitan Area Cable Commission, if there's any opportunity for them to fund a studio at the elementary school. I will 

[01:04:13] **Leah Silber:** certainly try the meetings this Friday.

[01:04:14] I didn't see anything in the paperwork so far about donuts, but the other stuff is on my list. 

[01:04:19] **Chris Barhyte:** Yeah. Yeah, I know they do have money for that. Uh, as long as people still have cable and a lot of places, it might be an opportunity. You may want to ask Thaddeus if that's even an opportunity to do a, a studio at the elementary school.

[01:04:33] It'd be really neat for us to get back in person, so, yeah. Um, okay. Anything else? Uh, so I guess that's it. So we'll move on to council reports. Um, I can start. So as you know, we have, we're working on getting the Canal Road fixed and I wanted to let everybody know we did have a conversation with Lake Oswego in the permitting process with Lake Oswego to pave the road [01:05:00] is significantly long.

[01:05:02] So when people say we have a, uh, long process, lake Oswego beats us by a long shot. So, uh, it could take three to four months on the permitting side for that project down there. It's not that it's expensive, it's just takes a long time to go through their process. They were very clear about that. So I just wanna let everybody know that the process in every city seems to take a long time.

[01:05:26] So that's my report. Uh, council President, Tuttle,

[01:05:35] **Bill Tuttle:** nothing.

[01:05:38] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Uh, councilor McClain. 

[01:05:43] **Doug McLean:** Uh, not too much, uh, although, um, I did talk to Andrew Klausner. Um, he was able, I was able, unable to get down to the park, uh, in Heritage Park when it started freezing. [01:06:00] But, um, he went over and, uh, pulled the valve out of the, uh, faucet and, uh, shut off the water and disconnected the hose from the, uh, fireman's faucet that's over there so it can not freeze also.

[01:06:15] Um, but anyhow, he's, and he just asked about what if he just keeps the valve, and I said, that's probably just a great idea. 'cause he told me he's over there all the time. He always goes running around that track and he's probably the one that uses the fountain the most anyway. Um, so I just wanna let everybody know that little valve that's inside, he has that now.

[01:06:36] Uh, so he'll take care of putting it in and uh, taking in it out I think for, uh, future stuff here. Anyway, um, trying to think. Anything else? Uh, not really. Park mo's dun done. [01:07:00] So yeah, we're pretty much just running even right now. 

[01:07:05] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Councilor s Silber, 

[01:07:09] **Leah Silber:** uh, nothing for me. Hopefully I'll, we'll have the MACC meeting this Friday and if there's anything interesting to report, I'll let everybody know next week, next meeting.

[01:07:19] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay, perfect. And then it's with sadness that I have to call on Councilor Schaefer because it's her last meeting. Thank you for being done. Do you have any reports? 

[01:07:31] **Rachel Schaefer:** Nothing for me. It's been a great honor. Wishing the city of Rivergrove all the best. 

[01:07:38] **Chris Barhyte:** Well, we appreciate everything done. Thank you for your 

[01:07:40] **Analeis Weidlich:** service.

[01:07:40] **Leah Silber:** We appreciate you. 

[01:07:42] **Doug McLean:** Yes. To see you. Really good job. Really nice to work with you on some stuff. I hope you'll still be around, 

[01:07:52] **Analeis Weidlich:** so for sure. We're not going anywhere. Yeah, 

[01:07:55] **Leah Silber:** well there's just not that many of us in the city, so you'll just have to take another turn soon. [01:08:00] 

[01:08:00] **Bill Tuttle:** Yeah, exactly. Hopefully you'll sit in on our meetings.

[01:08:09] I doubt that. And offers Sage commentary.

[01:08:15] That has nothing to do with the parks and the plant.

[01:08:21] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Uh, yeah, so thank you very much. So we'll go to councilor or uh, city Manager Report. 

[01:08:27] **Analeis Weidlich:** Uh, I think I've already said everything I'm gonna say. I, I, we don't have, I don't have anything more. 

[01:08:33] **Chris Barhyte:** Okay. Uh, well, Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah, happy holidays. Happy everything. Enjoy your time, and I'll see everybody in January.

[01:08:43] All right. Meetings adjourned. Thank you. 

[01:08:46] **Doug McLean:** Thank you.
