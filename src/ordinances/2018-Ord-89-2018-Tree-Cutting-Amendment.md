The applicant bears the burden of showing that the granting of the permit would be consistent with the stated purposes of the Rivergrove Tree Ordinance and Land Development Ordinance (RLDO). The following criteria shall be considered by the Planning Commission and/or City Staff when granting permits:

1. The necessity to remove trees in order to construct proposed improvements or otherwise utilize the applicant's property in a reasonable manner.
2. The topography of the land and the effect of tree removal on erosion, soil retention, stability of earth, flow of surface waters, protection of nearby trees, windbreaks, and desirable balance between shade and open space.
3. The number of trees in the existing neighborhood, the character and property uses in the neighborhood, and the effect of tree removal upon the neighborhood characteristics, beauty, and property values.
4. The adequacy of the Mitigation Plan submitted to the City, including a drainage plan, if appropriate.
5. Other possible alternatives, such as tree treatment, pruning, or relocating site improvements or utilities to resolve the applicant's request.

### (F) MITIGATION PLANS

1. All applications for tree cutting permits shall include a Mitigation Plan. The number and type of trees to be planted in mitigation for tree cutting in these permits shall be determined on a case by case basis, depending on each unique site. The City Arborist shall review and comment on the Mitigation Plan before they are approved or denied by the Planning Commission.

2. The Mitigation Plan must include at least the following information:
   a. The species and caliper of mitigation tree(s) are to be planted,
   b. A site map showing the location of trees to be removed, the location of trees to be planted, and any proposed development on site,
   c. A schedule with the proposed planting date,
   d. Identification of measures to be taken to keep the mitigation tree(s) alive during the first five years after planting, and
   e. A Performance Bond, warranty, or other security acceptable to the City to ensure that all mitigation trees survive for a five-year period after planting. This shall be required only if the value of the mitigation trees and their installation exceeds $500 in costs.

3. Mitigation trees shall be installed on the same property as the trees that were removed. If there is not sufficient room for the mitigation trees on the same property, the Planning Commission may approve other nearby locations. Rivergrove City Parks are usually not acceptable as an alternate planting location. All mitigation trees shall be subject to the City's Tree Planting Standards, Survivability Warranty, and Bonding requirements.

4. It is highly recommended that Mitigation trees be chosen from the Native Tree list, particularly in WQRA or Flood Hazard areas. It is recommended that other areas use the Approved Tree List.

5. An approved Mitigation Plan may require the retention of dead or dying trees or tree trunks located in wetlands, natural areas, stream corridors, parks or open space areas, in order to provide for wildlife habitat and natural processes, unless the tree presents a potential hazard to persons or property or conflicts with development of the property.

6. The Planning Commission may accept as mitigation trees that were planted prior to the application for a tree cutting permit.

7. Failure to conform to an approved Mitigation Plan within a time set by the Planning Commission and in the permit, shall incur a penalty as set forth in the RLDO.

The following standards shall be implemented by the Planning Commission during its review and the Planning Commission shall impose conditions of approvals for improvements, subdivisions and lot development approvals:

1. Each development or lot subdivision in Rivergrove comprised of one or more lots must plant at least one tree per 35' of frontage on any side of the property that borders a street or vehicular right of way, including driveways or other access. Planting shall be on the lot(s) and in the front yard(s). Exact tree location(s) to ensure thriving trees shall be determined in the development approval process.

2. Trees required to be planted as a result of development are to be chosen from Rivergrove's Approved Tree List, or a species and variety deemed acceptable to the Planning Commission, as advised by the City Arborist.

4. The Planning Commission shall allow the cutting of trees on an established lot in order to construct proposed improvements or to otherwise utilize the applicant's property to the extent allowed by law. When an application includes any tree cutting for subdivision, single lot development, or improvements, the Planning Commission shall require a report by a Certified Arborist or a review by the City Arborist regarding the impact of the tree cutting.

5. In a development that involves the creation of more than one lot, the Planning Commission shall require both a report by the developer's Certified Arborist and a review by the City Arborist.

6. The Planning Commission shall consider requiring the applicant to use an alternate site layout, alternative setbacks, or hardship relief for maximum tree preservation.

7. A tree cutting permit issued for construction of an improvement or utility shall not be valid, and no trees shall be cut, until all building permits or development permits have been issued by the City, County, or any other required approving agencies (local, State, or Federal).

8. All trees on any parcel or lot, other than those to be cut or pruned at the time of development, are considered Protected Trees. The City Arborist or a Certified Arborist shall designate a Tree Protection Zone and require adequate Protective Fencing before work of any kind proceeds at the site.

3. All trees planted must be 2 1/2" Caliper according to the Ordinance Definitions, unless an appropriate exception or alternate size is granted by the Planning Commission.

4. After planting trees required by this Ordinance, and following acceptance of completion by the Planning Commission, the owner shall warrant the new trees and provide for the replacement of those which did not survive for a period of no less than five (5) years.

5. In the event that new trees proposed to be planted as part of a Mitigation Plan are not installed upon application for final plan approval, then a performance bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to one hundred and ten (110) percent of the value of the new trees and their installation shall be posted in accordance with the performance bonding requirements in the Rivergrove Land Development Ordinance.

### (I) EVIDENCE OF VIOLATION

1. If any tree is removed without a tree cutting permit, a violation shall be determined by measuring the stump. A stump measured at the ground that is 44" or more in circumference shall be considered prima facie evidence of a violation.

2. Removal of the stump of a tree cut without a cutting permit prior to the measurement determination above is a violation of this ordinance.

3. Proof of violation on a property shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the property owner committed such violation. Prosecution of or failure to prosecute the owner shall not be deemed to relieve any other responsible individual property owner, legal entity, or collective parties.

### (J) PENALTIES

1. Cutting a tree in violation of the Ordinance, breaching the term or conditions of a permit granted under this Ordinance, or violation of any other provision of this Ordinance is an offense punishable by fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per tree. The unlawful cutting of each individual tree is a separate offense.

2. The City retains the authority to require the applicant to replace any illegally removed trees according to an approved Mitigation Plan; to keep such replacement trees alive for a designated period of years and to meet any conditions as set forth by the Planning Commission.

### (K) RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REGULATIONS

1. **Relationship to other City, Regional, State and Federal regulations:**
   a. In addition to the requirements of this Ordinance and the City's Land Development Ordinance, tree cutting and planting actions shall comply with all other City, regional, state, and federal regulations, including the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
   b. Compliance with this Ordinance does not in any way imply, either directly or indirectly, compliance with any other law. Where the provisions of this Ordinance conflict with those set forth in other regulations under the City code or ordinance, the more restrictive requirement shall prevail. When both provisions are equally restrictive, the most recently adopted requirement shall prevail, except in matters affecting public safety.
   c. References in this ordinance to other City, regional, state, or federal regulations do not constitute a complete list of such regulations. These references do not imply any responsibility by the City for enforcement of regional, state or federal regulations.
