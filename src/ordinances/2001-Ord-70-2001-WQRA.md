# ORDINANCE # 70-2001

**AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING AMENDMENTS TO THE RIVERGROVE LAND DEVELOPMENT AND FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCES AND THE RIVERGROVE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF METRO'S URBAN GROWTH MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONAL PLAN.**

## Statutory Authorization

The legislature of the State of Oregon has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. **Therefore, the City of Rivergrove ordains as follows:**

## Water Quality and Flood Management Area Ordinance

### Section I. Intent

The purpose of this ordinance is:

**A.** To protect and improve water quality, to support the designated beneficial water uses and to protect the functions and values of existing and newly established Water Quality Resource Areas, by:

1. Providing and improving the vegetated corridor separating Protected Water Features from development;
2. Maintaining or reducing stream temperatures;
3. Maintaining natural stream corridors;
4. Minimizing erosion, nutrient and pollutant loading into water;
5. Providing filtration, infiltration and natural water purification; and
6. Stabilizing slopes to prevent landslides contributing to the sedimentation of protected water features.

**B.** To protect and maintain Flood Management Areas, which provide for:

1. Protection of life and property from dangers associated with flooding;
2. The storage and conveyance of stream flows through existing and natural conveyance systems, flood storage, reduction of flood velocities, reduction of flood peak flows and reduction of wind and wave impacts;
3. Maintenance of water quality by reducing and sorting sediment loads, processing chemical and organic wastes and reducing nutrients;
4. Recharging, storage and discharging of groundwater; and
5. Plant and animal habitat, and the support of riparian ecosystems.

**C.** To establish overlay zones, Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas, which operate contemporaneously with base zones and implement the performance standards found herein.

### Section II. Applicability

**A.** This ordinance applies to:

1. Development in Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas.
2. Development that may cause visible or measurable erosion on any property within the City of Rivergrove.

**B.** This ordinance does not apply to work necessary to protect, repair, maintain, or replace existing structures, utility facilities, roadways, driveways, accessory uses and exterior improvements in response to emergencies provided that after the emergency has passed, adverse impacts are mitigated in accordance with Table 2 standards for restoring marginal existing vegetated corridors.

**Note:** Prior to doing any emergency work in a Water Quality Resource Area it is advisable to check with other regulatory agencies, including but not limited to, the U. S. Army Corp of Engineers, the National Marine Fishery Service, the Oregon Division of State Lands, Oregon Fish & Wildlife Department, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and Clackamas County.

1. The text provisions of this ordinance, including the definitions, shall determine whether an application for development is subject to the requirements of this ordinance.
2. Existing map information on file with the City shall be used as a reference to identify areas within a Water Quality Resource Area or Flood Management Area.
3. Applications shall include a delineation of any Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas on the subject property.
4. The map information provided shall be interpreted by the City to define and refine the exact location of the boundaries of Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas.

**B.** A development permit shall be obtained before development begins within any Water Quality Resource Area and/or Flood Management Area.

**C.** The Planning Commission is hereby appointed to administer and implement this ordinance. Duties of the Planning Commission shall include, but not be limited to:

1. Permit review including:
   - **a.** Review of all development permit applications to determine that the requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied;
   - **b.** Review all development permit applications to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required;
2. Review and maintenance of:
   - **a.** Information accepted by the Planning Commission as delineating Protected Water Features, Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas;
   - **b.** Information showing the actual elevation of the lowest floor of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement;
3. Interpretation of this ordinance.

### Section IV. Water Quality Resource Areas

**A.** This ordinance establishes a Water Quality Resource Area Overlay Zone.

**B.** The Water Quality Resource Area is the vegetated corridor and the Protected Water Feature. The width of the vegetated corridor is specified in the Table One. At least three slope measurements along the water feature, at no more than 100-foot increments, shall be made for each property for which development is proposed. Depending on the width of the property, the width of the vegetated corridor will vary.

#### Table 1

| **Protected Water Feature Type**        | **Slope Adjacent to Protected Water Feature** | **Starting Point for Measurements from Water Feature**                           | **Width of Vegetated Corridor**                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Protected Water Features¹**   | < 25%                                         | • Edge of bankful stage or 2-year storm level;<br>• Delineated edge of wetland | 50 feet                                                                                             |
| **Primary Protected Water Features¹**   | >25% for 150 feet or more⁵                    | • Edge of bankful stage or 2-year storm level;<br>• Delineated edge of wetland | 200 feet                                                                                            |
| **Primary Protected Water Features¹**   | >25% for less than 150 feet⁵                  | • Edge of bankful stage or 2-year storm level;<br>• Delineated edge of wetland | Distance from starting point of measurement to top of ravine (break in >25% slope)³, plus 50 feet.⁴ |
| **Secondary Protected Water Features²** | < 25%                                         | • Edge of bankful stage or 2-year storm level;<br>• Delineated edge of wetland | 15 feet                                                                                             |
| **Secondary Protected Water Features²** | > 25%                                         | • Edge of bankful stage or 2-year storm level;<br>• Delineated edge of wetland | 50 feet                                                                                             |

¹ **Primary Protected Water Features.** See definition of Protected Water Feature.  
² **Secondary Protected Water Features.** See definition of Protected Water Feature.  
³ Where the _Protected Water Feature_ is confined by a ravine or gully, the top of ravine is the break in the > 25% slope (see slope measurement in Appendix).  
⁴ A maximum reduction of 25 feet may be permitted in the width of _vegetated corridor_ beyond the slope break if a geotechnical report demonstrates that slope is stable. To establish the width of the _vegetated corridor_, slope should be measured in 25-foot increments away from the water feature until slope is less than 25% (top of ravine).  
⁵ _Vegetated corridors_ in excess of 50-feet for primary protected features, or in excess of 15-feet for secondary protected features apply on steep slopes only in the uphill direction from the _Protected Water Feature_.
⁶ Suggested method to determine two year recurrent flood elevations: obtain two year recurrent flood elevations from City of Tualatin at the Railroad Bridge Flood Gate, or, preferably, from the Lake Corp., at the head gate of the channel for Lake Oswego Canal, and extrapolate using FEMA flood-plain elevations.

### Section V. Flood Management Areas

**A.** This ordinance establishes a Flood Management Area Overlay Zone. The standards set forth herein apply to the Flood Management Areas in addition to other local, state or federal restrictions governing floodplains or flood hazard areas.

**B.** Flood Management Areas include land contained within the 100-year floodplain and floodway as shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance maps.

**C.** Uses Permitted Outright:

1. Excavation and fill required to plant any new trees or vegetation.
2. Restoration or enhancement of floodplains, riparian areas, wetland, upland and streams that meet federal and state standards.

**D.** Conditional Uses:  
All uses allowed in the base zone or existing flood hazard overlay zone are allowed in the Flood Management Overlay Zone subject to compliance with the Development Standards herein.

**E.** Prohibited Uses:

1. Any use prohibited in the base zone or existing flood hazard overlay zone.
2. Uncontained areas of hazardous materials as defined by the Department of Environmental Quality.

**F.** Application Requirements  
Applications for a development permit within any Flood Management Area Overlay Zone shall include, in addition to the items specified base zone:

1. Plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question, existing and proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities;
2. Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;
3. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed;
4. Demonstration that the plans meet the floodproofing criteria herein; and
5. Demonstration of how the development will impact flood storage capacities, watercourses and their velocities.
6. Other items deemed necessary and requested by the Planning Commission.

**G.** Development Standards  
All development, excavation and fill in the floodplain shall conform to the following standards:

1. No net fill in any floodplain is allowed. All fill placed in a floodplain shall be balanced with at least an equal amount of soil material removal.
2. Excavation areas shall not exceed fill areas by more than 50 percent of the square footage.
3. Any excavation below the 10 year flood elevation for the property shall not count toward compensating for the fill.
4. Excavation to balance a fill shall be located on the same parcel as the fill unless it is not reasonable or practicable to do so. In such cases, the excavation shall be located in the same drainage basin and as close as possible to the fill site, so long as the proposed excavation and fill will not increase flood impacts for surrounding properties as determined through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis.
5. For excavated areas identified by the city or county to remain dry in the summer, such as parks or mowed areas, the lowest elevation of the excavated area shall be at least 6 inches above the winter "low water" elevation, and sloped at a minimum of two percent towards the Protected Water Feature. One percent slopes will be allowed in smaller areas.
6. For excavated areas identified by the city or county to remain wet in the summer, such as a constructed wetland, the grade shall be designed not to drain into the Protected Water Feature.
7. Minimum finished floor elevations must be at least one foot above the design flood elevation for new habitable structures in the Flood Area.
8. Short-term parking in the floodplain may be located at an elevation of no more than one foot below the ten-year floodplain so long as the parking facilities do not occur in a Water Quality Resource Area. Long-term parking in the floodplain may be located at an elevation of no more than one foot below the 100-year floodplain so long as the parking facilities do not occur in a Water Quality Resource Area.
9. Temporary fills permitted during construction shall be removed.
10. New culverts, stream crossings and transportation projects shall be designed as balanced cut and fill projects or designed not to significantly raise the design flood elevation. Such projects shall be designed to minimize the area of fill in Flood Management Areas and to minimize erosive velocities. Stream crossings shall be as close to perpendicular to the stream as practicable. Bridges shall be used instead of culverts wherever practicable.
11. Excavation and fill required for the construction of detention facilities or structures, and other facilities, such as levees, specifically shall be designed to reduce or mitigate flood impacts and improve water quality. Levees shall not be used to create vacant buildable lands.

12. Venting  
    a. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
    (i) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
    (ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
    (iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
13. Anchoring  
    a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
    b. All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize load damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
14. Construction Materials and Methods  
    a. All new construction and substantial improvements lying below the 100-year flood elevation shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
    b. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
    c. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
15. Utilities  
    a. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
    b. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the system into flood waters; and,
    c. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
16. Subdivision Proposals  
    a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
    b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
    c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.

### Section VI. Subdivisions and Partitions

**A.** The purpose of this section is to amend the city regulations governing land divisions to require that new subdivision and partition plats delineate and show the Water Quality Resource Area as a separate tract.

**B.** The standards for land divisions in Water Quality Resource Areas Overlay Zone shall apply in addition to the requirements of the city land division ordinance and zoning ordinance.

**C.** Prior to preliminary plat approval, the Water Quality Resource Area shall be shown as a separate tract, which shall not be a part of any parcel used for construction of a dwelling unit.

**D.** Prior to final plat approval, ownership of the Water Quality Resource Area tract shall be identified to distinguish it from lots intended for development. The tract may be identified as any one of the following:

1. Private open space held by the owner or homeowners association; or
2. For residential land divisions, private open space subject to an easement conveying storm and surface water management rights to the county and preventing the owner of the tract from activities and uses inconsistent with the purpose of this ordinance; or
3. At the owner's option, public open space where the tract has been dedicated to the city or other governmental unit; or
4. Any other ownership proposed by the owner and approved by the City Council.

**Note:** Approval by the governmental unit of any dedication or transfer to the governmental unit is required prior to transfer.

**E.** Where the Water Quality Resource Area tract is dedicated to the city or other governmental unit, development shall be subject to a minimum 3-foot setback from the Water Quality Resource Area.

**F.** The density of development that would otherwise be permitted on an area of land contained within a Water Quality Resource Area tract that is set aside as provided above may be transferred to adjacent lots. Once density is transferred from a lot within the Water Quality Resource Area, the increase allocated to the transfer lot may not be transferred to any other lot. Density transfers shall be noted on the partition or subdivision map.

### Section VII. Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control

**A.** The purpose of this section is to require erosion prevention measures and sediment control practices for all development inside and outside the Water Quality Resource Area and Flood Management Area Overlay Zones during construction to prevent and restrict the discharge of sediments, and to require final permanent erosion prevention measures, which may include landscaping, after development is completed. Erosion prevention techniques shall be designed to protect soil particles from the force of water and wind so that they will not be transported from the site. Sediment control measures shall be designed to capture soil particles after they have become dislodged by erosion and attempt to retain the soil particles on site.

**B.** Prior to beginning work the applicant shall obtain an Erosion and Sediment Control Permit from the County.

**C.** The County may inspect the development site to determine compliance with the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and Permit.

**D.** Erosion that occurs on a development site that does not have an Erosion and Sediment Control Permit, or that results from a failure to comply with the terms of such a Permit, constitutes a violation of this ordinance.

_Note: Sections E and F are missing from the original source document, this is not a digitization error._

**G.** If the County finds that the facilities and techniques approved in an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and Permit are not sufficient to prevent erosion, the County shall notify the permittee. Upon receiving notice, the permittee shall immediately install interim erosion and sediment control measures as required by the County. If required by the County, the applicant shall submit and implement a revised Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.

### Section VIII. Variances

**A.** The purpose of this Section is to ensure that compliance with this ordinance does not cause unreasonable hardship. To avoid such instances, the requirements of this ordinance may be varied. Variances are also allowed when strict application of this ordinance would deprive an owner of all economically viable use of land.

**B.** This Section applies in addition to the standards governing proposals to vary the requirements of the base zone.

**C.** The Planning Commission shall, upon receiving an application to vary the requirements of this ordinance, provide notice of the request to all property owners within (200) feet.

**D.** Development may occur on lots located completely within the Water Quality Resource Area Overlay Zone that were legally created on or before the date this ordinance was adopted or on lots legally created after the adoption of this ordinance so long as the application to create the lot or lots was deemed complete prior to the adoption of this ordinance. Development shall not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of the vegetated corridor, including access roads and driveways, subject to the erosion and sediment control standards of this ordinance.

**E.** Hardship Variance  
Variances to avoid unreasonable hardship caused by the strict application of this ordinance are permitted subject to the criteria set forth in this section. To vary from the requirements of this ordinance, the applicant must demonstrate the following:

1. The variance is the minimum necessary to allow the proposed use or activity;
2. The variance does not increase danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;
3. The impact of the increase in flood hazard, which will result from the variance, will not prevent the city or county from meeting the requirements of this ordinance. In support of this criteria the applicant shall have a qualified professional engineer document the expected height, velocity and duration of flood waters, and estimate the rate of increase in sediment transport of the flood waters expected both downstream and upstream as a result of the variance;
4. The variance will not increase the cost of providing and maintaining public services during and after flood conditions so as to unduly burden public agencies and taxpayers;
5. Unless the proposed variance is from Section IV F.9 (mitigation) or Section VII (erosion control), the proposed use will comply with those standards; and
6. The proposed use complies with the standards of the base zone.

**F.** Buildable Lot Variance  
A variance to avoid the loss of substantial economically viable use of a lot that is partially inside the Water Quality Resource Area Overlay Zone is permitted. Development on such lots shall not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of the vegetated corridor, including access roads and driveways, subject to the erosion and sediment control standards in Section VII of this ordinance. Applicants must demonstrate the following:

1. Without the proposed variance, the applicant would be denied economically viable use of the subject property. To meet this criterion, the applicant must show that:
   - **a.** The proposed use cannot meet the standards in Section VIII E (hardship variance); and
   - **b.** No other application could result in permission for an economically viable use of the subject property. Evidence to meet this criterion shall include a list of uses allowed on the subject property.
2. The proposed variance is the minimum necessary to allow for the requested use;
3. The proposed variance will comply with Section IV F.9 (mitigation) and Section VII (erosion control); and
4. The proposed use complies with the standards of the base zone.

**G.** Variance Conditions  
The Planning Commission may impose such conditions as are deemed necessary to limit any adverse impacts that may result from granting relief. If a variance is granted pursuant to Subsections E 1-6, the variance shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. The minimum width of the vegetated corridor shall be 15 feet on each side of a Primary Protected Water Feature, except as allowed in Section IV C and D;
2. No more than 25 percent of the length of the Water Quality Resource Area for a Primary Protected Water Feature within a development site can be less than 30 feet in width on each side of the water feature; and
3. In either case, the average width of the Water Quality Resource Area shall be a minimum of 15 feet on each side for Secondary Protected Water Features, a minimum of 50 feet on each side for Primary Protected Water Features, or up to 200 feet on each side in areas with slopes greater than 25 percent. The stream shall be allowed to meander within this area, but in no case shall the stream be less than 10 feet from the outer boundary of the Water Quality Resource Area.

### Section IX. Map Administration

**A.** The purpose of this section is to provide for maps designating the Protected Water Features, Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas in the City of Rivergrove.

**B.** Copies of the maps on file which have been accepted by the city as delineating a Protected Water Feature or the Flood Management Area shall be submitted to Metro to update Metro's Water Quality Management Maps and may be used by the city as a reference.

**C.** When the city makes a finding in the processing of a new application that adds, corrects or alters the location of a Protected Water Feature, Water Quality Resource Area and/or Flood Management Area it shall retain the map for future reference and submit a copy to Metro to update Metro's Water Quality Management Maps. Areas added to Wetlands, Water Quality Resource Areas and Flood Management Areas in mitigation of uses allowed herein shall be treated as an addition or alteration of the location of a Protected Water Feature, Water Quality Resource Area and/or Flood Management Area.

### Section X. Consistency

Where the provisions of this ordinance are less restrictive or conflict with comparable provisions of the zoning ordinance, regional, state or federal law, the provisions that are more restrictive shall govern. Where this ordinance imposes restrictions that are more stringent than regional, state and federal law, the provisions of this ordinance shall govern.

### Section XI. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability

The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City or County, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

### Section XII. Severability and Interpretation

**A.** If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this ordinance should be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality thereof shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this ordinance.

**B.** Any conflict between the text of this ordinance and any heading, caption, figure, illustration, table or map is resolved in favor of the text.

### Section XIII. Enforcement

**A.** No person shall engage in or cause to occur any development, use or activity that fails to meet the standards and requirements of this ordinance.

**B.** In addition to other powers the city or county may exercise to enforce this ordinance, the city or county may:

1. Establish a cooperative agreement between the city and the applicant (or responsible party) to remedy the violation.
2. Issue a stop work order.
3. Impose a civil penalty of not more than $500 for each violation upon the permittee, contractor or person responsible for carrying out the development work. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.
4. Cause an action to be instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction.
5. Authorize summary abatement and subsequent recovery of costs incurred by the city.

**Vegetated Corridor** - the area of setback between the top of bank of a Protected Water Feature and the delineated edge of the Water Quality Resource Area as defined in Table 1.

**Visible or Measurable Erosion** - Visible or measurable erosion includes, but is not limited to:

Deposits of mud, dirt sediment or similar material exceeding one-half cubic foot in volume on public or private streets, adjacent property, or onto the storm and surface water system, either by direct deposit, dropping discharge, or as a result of the action of erosion. Evidence of concentrated flows of water over bare soils; turbid or sediment laden flows; or evidence of on-site erosion such as rivulets on bare soil slopes, where the flow of water is not filtered or captured on the site. Earth slides, mudflows, earth sloughing, or other earth movement that leaves the property.

**Water Quality Resource Areas** - The Protected Water Feature and the adjacent Vegetated Corridor as established in this ordinance.

**Watershed** - A watershed is a geographic unit defined by the flows of rainwater or snowmelt. All land in a watershed drains to a common outlet, such as a stream, lake or wetland.

**Wetlands** - Wetlands are those areas inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands are those areas identified and delineated by a qualified wetland specialist as set forth in the most recent Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual and created wetlands.

**Advantages:**

- Provides protection for most steep slopes, yet corridor widths can be varied to fit a number of different situations (corridor widths include 50 feet to 100 feet, 125 feet, 150 feet, 175 feet, and 200 feet)
- Provides flexibility.

**Disadvantages:**

- Does not protect slopes that rise steeply after a gradual "floodplain" area.
