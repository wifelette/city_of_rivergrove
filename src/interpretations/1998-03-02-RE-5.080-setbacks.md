# An Interpretation of the Planning Commission

## March 2, 1998

Section 5.080 of the Rivergrove Land Development Ordinance (RLDO) establishes General Building Setbacks in All Zones and Districts.

The acknowledged RLDO on file at the Department of Land Conservation and Development does not specify how the setbacks are to be measured (whether from / to the building wall line or from / to the roof edge or drip line).

The uncertainty / ambiguity that results from this lack of specificity within the text of the RLDO can be eliminated by an "interpretation" of the Planning Commission.

The Planning Commission has the authority and responsibility to interpret the RLDO (Section 3.090 of the RLDO). That interpretation shall be in writing and shall be available with copies of the RLDO. The following interpretation of Section 9.030 is hereby adopted by the Planning Commission at its regular meeting on March 2, 1998. Until this Section is revised or until a different interpretation of this Section is adopted by the Planning Commission, this Section shall be applied and enforced in accordance with the following interpretation:

## INTERPRETATION
