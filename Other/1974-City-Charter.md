In no case shall more than $500 be recovered as damages for an injury, damage, or death resulting from such a defect or dangerous place.

But in no event shall the action be started until 60 days have elapsed after the presentation of this notice to the council.

**Section 43. Existing Ordinances Continued.**  
All ordinances of the city consistent with this charter and in force when it takes effect shall remain in effect until amended or repealed.
