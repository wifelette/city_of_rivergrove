<p><strong>THE RIVERGROVE CITY COUNCIL FINDS AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sanitary sewer services in the City of Rivergrove are provided to Rivergrove residents by the City of Lake Oswego in accordance with an Intergovernmental Agreement for Sewerage Services (“IGA”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the terms of the IGA, and in exchange for the provisions of sanitary sewer services, the City of Rivergrove agreed to apply and enforce several provisions in the Lake Oswego City Code (“LOC”) in the City of Rivergrove. More specifically, the City of Rivergrove agreed to the application and enforcement of the provisions related to sanitary sewer service in Chapters 38, 39, and 40 of the LOC, and Chapter 14 of the Lake Oswego Utility Design Standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having agreed to let the City of Lake Oswego apply and enforce provision of its code in the City of Rivergrove, it is necessary and in the best interests of the City of Rivergrove to adopt an ordinance that both consents to the application and enforcement of the identified LOC provisions and provides a process under which the City of Rivergrove will adopt a recommendation in support of a proposed local improvement district (“LID”) or zone of benefit (“ZOB”).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY OF RIVERGROVE RESOLVES AND ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p>
<h3 id="section-1"><a class="header" href="#section-1">Section 1</a></h3>
<p>The following words and phrases that are used in this ordinance shall have the following meaning:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> City Council means the Rivergrove City Council.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Local improvement district or LID has the meaning given that phrase in Chapter 40 of the Lake Oswego City Code.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Person means an individual or any legal entity, including the City of Lake Oswego.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Resolution application means the information that must be submitted to the City of Rivergrove to obtain the City Council’s recommendation on a proposed ZOB or LID.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Zone of Benefit or ZOB has the meaning given that term in Chapter 40 of the Lake Oswego City Code.</p>
<h3 id="section-2"><a class="header" href="#section-2">Section 2.</a></h3>
<p>The City of Rivergrove hereby adopts by reference those portions of Chapters 38, 39 and 40 of the Lake Oswego City Code (“LOC”), and Chapter 14 of the Lake Oswego Utility Design Standards, that exist on the date of the adoption of this ordinance and are related to sanitary sewer services, in the City of Rivergrove, subject to the following:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Before the City of Lake Oswego may accept and take action on an application to create a local improvement district (“LID”) or zone of benefit (“ZOB”), the City of Lake Oswego shall receive a resolution from the City Council that includes a recommendation in support of the proposed LID or ZOB.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Any person applying to the City of Lake Oswego to form a LID or ZOB shall submit a resolution application to the City of Rivergrove requesting the City Council adopt a resolution with a recommendation in support of the proposed LID or ZOB. The resolution application shall be submitted on a form provided by the City of Rivergrove and shall include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A copy of the LID or ZOB application that will be submitted to the City of Lake Oswego; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application fee equal to the amount of money the City of Rivergrove anticipates it will cost to review the proposed LID or ZOB and adopt a resolution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Upon receipt of a complete resolution application, the Rivergrove Planning Commission may review it at its next regularly scheduled meeting as a discussion item on its agenda. The Planning Commission may submit to the City Council its recommendation concerning the resolution application. However, with or without the Planning Commission review and/or recommendation, the City of Rivergrove shall schedule a public hearing before the City Council at which the City Council will accept public testimony (either written or oral) from any interested party and decide whether or not to adopt a recommendation in support of the proposed LID or ZOB. Notice of such a public hearing shall be published in the monthly edition of the Rivergrove Report published immediately preceding the public hearing and posted in at least three conspicuous places within the City and at City Hall, and mailed to each resident of Rivergrove that is an owner of property to be included in the proposed LID or ZOB at least 30 days prior to the public hearing before the City Council. If the City Council finds the proposed LID or ZOB is in the collective best interests of the citizens of the City of Rivergrove, the City Council may adopt a resolution in support of the proposed LID or ZOB. In making its public interest decision, the City Council may consider, among other matters, the potential hardship / undue financial burden that could befall one or more citizens as a result of the proposed LID or ZOB. If a resolution in support of the proposed LID or ZOB is adopted, the City Council may include as specific conditions of its expressed support any detailed parameters of the proposed LID or ZOB that the Council deems appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> After the City Council adopts a resolution in support of the proposed LID or ZOB, or decides not to adopt such a resolution, or an applicant files a written request withdrawing the application for a resolution, the City of Rivergrove will refund any portion of the application fee that exceeds the costs that Rivergrove incurred in processing the application for the resolution. If, at any time, the costs incurred by the City of Rivergrove in processing the resolution application exceed the amount of the application fee, the City of Rivergrove may postpone action on the application until the applicant deposits supplemental application fee(s) to cover the additional incurred and estimated costs. If, at the completion of the processing of the application, the actual costs incurred exceeded the estimated costs upon which the initial application fee was based, the applicant shall be responsible for paying to the City of Rivergrove an amount to cover the additional incurred costs.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> After forwarding a resolution supporting the LID or ZOB, the City of Lake Oswego shall have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with these matters in a manner strictly consistent with the terms of the resolution of support to include any conditions contained therein, insofar as they relate to the delivery of sanitary sewer services.</p>
