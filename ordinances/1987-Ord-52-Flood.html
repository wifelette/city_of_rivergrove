<h3 id="section-10"><a class="header" href="#section-10">SECTION 1.0</a></h3>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<h4 id="11-statutory-authorization"><a class="header" href="#11-statutory-authorization">1.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION</a></h4>
<p>The Legislature of the State of <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Oregon</span> has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council</span> of <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Rivergrove, Oregon</span>, does ordain as follows:</p>
<h4 id="12-findings-of-fact"><a class="header" href="#12-findings-of-fact">1.2 FINDINGS OF FACT</a></h4>
<p>(1) The flood hazard areas of <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">Rivergrove</span> are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.</p>
<p>(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.</p>
<h4 id="13-statement-of-purpose"><a class="header" href="#13-statement-of-purpose">1.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</a></h4>
<p>It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:</p>
<ol><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(1)</span> To protect human life and health;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(2)</span> To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(3)</span> To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(4)</span> To minimize prolonged business interruptions;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(5)</span> To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(6)</span> To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(7)</span> To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and,</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(8)</span> To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.</li></ol>
<h4 id="14-methods-of-reducing-flood-losses"><a class="header" href="#14-methods-of-reducing-flood-losses">1.4 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES</a></h4>
<p>In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for:</p>
<ol><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(1)</span> Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(2)</span> Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(3)</span> Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(4)</span> Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(5)</span> Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.</li></ol>

<h3 id="section-20"><a class="header" href="#section-20">SECTION 2.0</a></h3>
<p><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p>Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application.</p>
<p><strong>“APPEAL”</strong> means a request for a review of the <span class="form-field-filled" data-tooltip="Field filled in on source doc">City Council’s</span> interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.</p>
<p><strong>“AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING”</strong> means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and, velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.</p>
<p><strong>“AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD”</strong> means the land in the flood plain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.</p>
<p><strong>“BASE FLOOD”</strong> means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.” Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.</p>
<p><strong>“DEVELOPMENT”</strong> means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard.</p>
<ol><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(1)</span> The overflow of inland or tidal waters and/or</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(2)</span> The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.</li></ol>
<p><strong>“FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)”</strong> means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.</p>
<p><strong>“FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY”</strong> means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.</p>
<p><strong>“FLOODWAY”</strong> means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.</p>
<p><strong>“LOWEST FLOOR”</strong> means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance found at Section 5.2-1(2).</p>
<p><strong>“MANUFACTURED HOME”</strong> means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term “manufactured home” does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>“MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION”</strong> means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.</p>
<p><strong>“New Construction”</strong> means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>“START OF CONSTRUCTION”</strong> includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.</p>
<p><strong>“STRUCTURE”</strong> means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.</p>
<ol><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(1)</span> before the improvement or repair is started, or</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(2)</span> if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.</li></ol>
<ol><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(1)</span> any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or</li><li><span class="custom-list-marker">(2)</span> any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.</li></ol>
<p><strong>“VARIANCE”</strong> means a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this ordinance.</p>

<h4 id="44-2-conditions-for-variances"><a class="header" href="#44-2-conditions-for-variances">4.4-2 Conditions for Variances</a></h4>
<p>(1) Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (i-xi) in Section 4.4-1(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.</p>
<p>(2) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.</p>
<p>(3) Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.</p>
<p>(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.</p>
<p>(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(i) a showing of good and sufficient cause;
(ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
(iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section 4.1-4(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.</p>
<p>(6) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.</p>
<p>(7) Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except 4.4-2(1), and otherwise complies with Sections 5.1-1 and 5.1-2 of the GENERAL STANDARDS.</p>
<p>(8) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.</p>

<p>Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source (Section 4.3-2), Applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.</p>
<h4 id="52-specific-standards"><a class="header" href="#52-specific-standards">5.2 SPECIFIC STANDARDS</a></h4>
<p>In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 3.2, BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD or Section 4.3-2, Use of Other Base Flood Data, the following provisions are required:</p>
<h4 id="52-1-residential-construction"><a class="header" href="#52-1-residential-construction">5.2-1 Residential Construction</a></h4>
