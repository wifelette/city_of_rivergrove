To achieve this purpose it is necessary to regulate the design, quality of materials, construction, location, electrification, illumination, and maintenance of signs that are visible from public property, public rights-of-way and private areas open to public travel.</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Except as provided in this ordinance, no person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish, equip, use or maintain any sign, or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> No owner shall erect or construct a sign on a site that contains unlawful signs.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> This ordinance shall not be construed to permit the erection or maintenance of any sign at any place or in any manner unlawful under any other city code provision or other applicable law.

<p><strong>D.</strong> This ordinance is not intended to, and does not restrict speech on the basis of its content, viewpoint or message. Any classification of signs in this ordinance that permits speech by reason of the type of sign, identity of the sign user or otherwise, shall permit any type of speech on the sign.

To the extent any provision of this ordinance is ambiguous, the term shall be interpreted to not regulate on the basis of speech content, and the interpretation resulting in the least restriction on the content of the sign message shall prevail.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is declared invalid for any reason by a court having jurisdiction under state or federal law, the remaining portions of this ordinance shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>Whenever a nonconforming sign is damaged and the estimated cost to repair the sign is 50 percent or less of its replacement value as of the day before the sign was damaged, it may be repaired and restored to the condition it was in before it was damaged and may continue to be used as a nonconforming sign, provided that such repairs and restoration are started within 90 days of the date the sign was damaged and are diligently pursued thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No nonconforming sign shall be permitted to remain unless properly repaired and maintained as provided in this ordinance. A sign maintained in violation of this provision shall be removed as provided in section 11 of this ordinance. Any nonconforming sign that is determined by the building official to be an unsafe sign shall be removed as provided in this ordinance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the maintenance of any sign, or regular manual changes of sign copy on a sign.</p>
<h3 id="section-10-construction-and-maintenance-standards"><a class="header" href="#section-10-construction-and-maintenance-standards">Section 10. Construction and Maintenance Standards.</a></h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> All permanent signs shall be constructed and erected in accordance with the requirements of the International Building Code, as adopted by the State of Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Building and electrical permits shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Prior to obtaining building and electrical permits, the applicant shall obtain a sign permit or demonstrate an exception from the permit requirements of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> All signs, together with all of their supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in good repair and be maintained in a safe condition. All signs and the site upon which they are located shall be maintained in a neat, clean, and attractive condition. Signs shall be kept free from excessive rust, corrosion, peeling paint or other surface deterioration. The display surfaces of all signs shall be kept neatly painted or posted.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> No sign shall be erected or maintained in such a manner that any portion of its surface or supports will interfere in any way with the free use of any fire escape, exit, or standpipe. No signs shall be erected or maintained so as to obstruct any building opening to such an extent that light or ventilation is reduced below minimums required by any applicable law or provisions of this code.</p>
<h3 id="section-11-removal-of-signs"><a class="header" href="#section-11-removal-of-signs">Section 11. Removal of Signs.</a></h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The City Manager may remove or may order the removal of any sign erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this ordinance or other applicable provisions of this code. Signs installed in violation of any prior sign code or applicable laws and regulations, and which are in violation of this ordinance, shall be removed, replaced or altered in order to conform to the requirements of this ordinance. An order to remove a sign shall be in writing and mailed to the owner of the sign or the owner of the building, structure or premises on which the sign is located.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> The order shall inform the owner that the sign violates the regulations in this ordinance and must be brought into compliance or be removed within 30 days of the date of the order. The City Manager may order immediate removal of a sign under subsection (G) of this section.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> If the owner fails to immediately remove an unsafe sign or otherwise fails to file an appeal or remove a sign within 30 days of the date of the City Manager’s order, or within the time provided in the decision rendered following an appeal, the City Manager shall cause the sign to be removed. The removal shall be at the expense of the owner of the sign or the owner of the building, structure, or premises on which the sign is located.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> These costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, the notification, efforts to secure compliance, painting out of a sign, sign removal, storage, transportation and attorneys fees, shall be a lien against land or premises on which the sign is located, and may be collected or foreclosed in the same manner as liens that are entered in the liens docket of the City of Rivergrove.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Instead of removing a sign, the City Manager may file charges against the sign owner in Rivergrove municipal court. Each day following the 30 day period in which the sign owner is not in compliance with this ordinance constitutes a separate violation.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Any sign installed or placed on public property, except in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance, shall be forfeited to the city and confiscated. Removal costs may be collected as provided in section 13 of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> If the City Manager finds that any sign is in violation of the applicable provision of this code and that, by reason of its condition, it presents an immediate and serious danger to the public, the City Manager may, without prior written notice, order the immediate removal or repair of the sign within a specified period. The City Manager may remove or authorize others to remove the sign in the event that the person responsible for such sign cannot be found or if that person, after notification, refuses to repair or remove it. The owner of the sign and the owner of the building, structure, or premises on which the sign is located, are jointly and severably liable for the cost of removing such sign as provided for in section 13 of this ordinance.</p>

At the expiration of the time specified in this section, if the person responsible for the sign or other interested person has not reclaimed the sign as provided herein, the City Manager may destroy the sign or dispose of it in any manner deemed appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> To reclaim any sign removed by the City Manager the person reclaiming the sign shall pay the city an amount equal to the costs incurred by the City Manager in enforcing this ordinance.</p>

The enforcement of this ordinance shall be a function of the availability of sufficient financial resources consistent with adopted budgetary priorities and prosecutorial priorities within the range of delegated discretion to the City Manager.</p>
