<ol>
<li>
<p>“Home Occupation” is an occupation or business activity which results in a product or service and which: is conducted, in whole or in part, in either the dwelling or in an accessory building normally associated with permitted uses; is conducted by at least one family member occupying the residence; and is clearly subordinate to the residential use of the dwelling and premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home occupations do not include garage sales, yard sales, Christmas bazaars, or home parties which are held for the purpose of the sale or distribution of goods or services. However, if such sales and/or parties are held more than six times in any calendar year, or operate in excess of 24 cumulative days in a calendar year, such sales and/or parties shall be considered a home occupation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="definition-item"><span class="definition-marker">(b)</span><span class="definition-content"> PURPOSE AND INTENT</span></div>
<p>The conduct of business in residences may be permitted under the provisions of this section. It is the intent of this section to only allow such uses which:</p>

<p>Ensure the compatibility of home occupations with other uses permitted in the district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain and preserve the character of the community and residential neighborhoods; and</p>

<p>In all zones permitting residences, minor home occupations in compliance with the following regulations are permitting as accessory uses. Due to their small scale and residential nature, minor home occupations are relatively common accessory uses which are not easily detectable and are not reasonable or desirable to regulate through a special use permit.</p>

<li>
<p>Character: There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the dwelling or premises or any visible evidence of the conduct of a minor home occupation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants: No more than one (1) person other than residents of the dwelling shall be employed in the conduct of a minor home occupation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage and Accessory Space: There shall be no storage of equipment, vehicles, or supplies associated with the minor home occupation outside the dwelling.</p>
</li>

<p>Display of Products: There shall be no display of products visible in any manner from the outside of the dwelling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signs: No advertising or display signs shall be permitted.</p>

<li>
<p>Parking: The use shall not require additional off-street parking spaces for clients or customers of the minor home occupation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traffic: The use shall not generate more than five vehicle trips to and from the property in one day. No vehicle associated with a home occupation shall be stored, parked, or repaired on public rights-of-way.</p>

<li>
<p>Noise, Equipment, and Process Restrictions:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="definition-item"><span class="definition-marker">(a)</span><span class="definition-content"> No equipment or process shall be used in a home occupation which creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, or odor detectable to normal sense off the property.</span></div>

<h3 id="section-9030-fees-and-system-development-charges"><a class="header" href="#section-9030-fees-and-system-development-charges">Section 9.030. Fees and System Development Charges.</a></h3>
<p>All fees and system development charges under this ordinance, and the Development Standards Document, shall be as outlined below. This fee schedule may be amended at any time by Resolution of the City Council. Fee must be paid to the City by the applicant at the time of application. Fees assessed to an applicant may include the costs to the City of legal services, hearings officers, engineering services, planning services, and design services as the City determines are necessary to consider the permit. When such costs are not known in advance, the City shall estimate the cost, and provide a full accounting at the end of the permit process. Overcharges will be refunded to the applicant, and the applicant shall be responsible to the City for any additional costs not covered by the estimate.</p>
<p>For construction of new residential units which will use streets and roads within the City of Rivergrove, the City may assess a roadway system development fee. This fee will be deposited in to the City’s Road fund and may be used only for the purposes legally allowed for road funds. The roadway system development fee may be waived by the City Council should the City determine it will be a hardship, and, at the City’s discretion, may credit the cost of required public facility improvements against such fees.</p>
