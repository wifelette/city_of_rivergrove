<p>¹ <strong>Primary Protected Water Features.</strong> See definition of Protected Water Feature.<br/>
² <strong>Secondary Protected Water Features.</strong> See definition of Protected Water Feature.<br/>
³ Where the <em>Protected Water Feature</em> is confined by a ravine or gully, the top of ravine is the break in the &gt; 25% slope (see slope measurement in Appendix).<br/>
⁴ A maximum reduction of 25 feet may be permitted in the width of <em>vegetated corridor</em> beyond the slope break if a geotechnical report demonstrates that slope is stable. To establish the width of the <em>vegetated corridor</em>, slope should be measured in 25-foot increments away from the water feature until slope is less than 25% (top of ravine).<br/>
⁵ <em>Vegetated corridors</em> in excess of 50-feet for primary protected features, or in excess of 15-feet for secondary protected features apply on steep slopes only in the uphill direction from the <em>Protected Water Feature</em>.
⁶ Suggested method to determine two year recurrent flood elevations: obtain two year recurrent flood elevations from City of Tualatin at the Railroad Bridge Flood Gate, or, preferably, from the Lake Corp., at the head gate of the channel for Lake Oswego Canal, and extrapolate using FEMA flood-plain elevations.</p>

Density transfers shall be noted on the partition or subdivision map.</p>
<h3 id="section-vii-erosion-prevention-and-sediment-control"><a class="header" href="#section-vii-erosion-prevention-and-sediment-control">Section VII. Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control</a></h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The purpose of this section is to require erosion prevention measures and sediment control practices for all development inside and outside the Water Quality Resource Area and Flood Management Area Overlay Zones during construction to prevent and restrict the discharge of sediments, and to require final permanent erosion prevention measures, which may include landscaping, after development is completed. Erosion prevention techniques shall be designed to protect soil particles from the force of water and wind so that they will not be transported from the site. Sediment control measures shall be designed to capture soil particles after they have become dislodged by erosion and attempt to retain the soil particles on site.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Prior to beginning work the applicant shall obtain an Erosion and Sediment Control Permit from the County.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The County may inspect the development site to determine compliance with the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and Permit.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Erosion that occurs on a development site that does not have an Erosion and Sediment Control Permit, or that results from a failure to comply with the terms of such a Permit, constitutes a violation of this ordinance.</p>
<p><em>Note: Sections E and F are missing from the original source document, this is not a digitization error.</em></p>
<p><strong>G.</strong> If the County finds that the facilities and techniques approved in an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and Permit are not sufficient to prevent erosion, the County shall notify the permittee. Upon receiving notice, the permittee shall immediately install interim erosion and sediment control measures as required by the County. If required by the County, the applicant shall submit and implement a revised Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.</p>
<h3 id="section-viii-variances"><a class="header" href="#section-viii-variances">Section VIII. Variances</a></h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The purpose of this Section is to ensure that compliance with this ordinance does not cause unreasonable hardship. To avoid such instances, the requirements of this ordinance may be varied. Variances are also allowed when strict application of this ordinance would deprive an owner of all economically viable use of land.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> This Section applies in addition to the standards governing proposals to vary the requirements of the base zone.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The Planning Commission shall, upon receiving an application to vary the requirements of this ordinance, provide notice of the request to all property owners within (200) feet.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Development may occur on lots located completely within the Water Quality Resource Area Overlay Zone that were legally created on or before the date this ordinance was adopted or on lots legally created after the adoption of this ordinance so long as the application to create the lot or lots was deemed complete prior to the adoption of this ordinance. Development shall not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of the vegetated corridor, including access roads and driveways, subject to the erosion and sediment control standards of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Hardship Variance<br/>
Variances to avoid unreasonable hardship caused by the strict application of this ordinance are permitted subject to the criteria set forth in this section. To vary from the requirements of this ordinance, the applicant must demonstrate the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The variance is the minimum necessary to allow the proposed use or activity;</li>
<li>The variance does not increase danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;</li>
<li>The impact of the increase in flood hazard, which will result from the variance, will not prevent the city or county from meeting the requirements of this ordinance. In support of this criteria the applicant shall have a qualified professional engineer document the expected height, velocity and duration of flood waters, and estimate the rate of increase in sediment transport of the flood waters expected both downstream and upstream as a result of the variance;</li>
<li>The variance will not increase the cost of providing and maintaining public services during and after flood conditions so as to unduly burden public agencies and taxpayers;</li>
<li>Unless the proposed variance is from Section IV F.9 (mitigation) or Section VII (erosion control), the proposed use will comply with those standards; and</li>
<li>The proposed use complies with the standards of the base zone.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Buildable Lot Variance<br/>
A variance to avoid the loss of substantial economically viable use of a lot that is partially inside the Water Quality Resource Area Overlay Zone is permitted. Development on such lots shall not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of the vegetated corridor, including access roads and driveways, subject to the erosion and sediment control standards in Section VII of this ordinance. Applicants must demonstrate the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Without the proposed variance, the applicant would be denied economically viable use of the subject property. To meet this criterion, the applicant must show that:
<ul>
<li><strong>a.</strong> The proposed use cannot meet the standards in Section VIII E (hardship variance); and</li>
<li><strong>b.</strong> No other application could result in permission for an economically viable use of the subject property. Evidence to meet this criterion shall include a list of uses allowed on the subject property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The proposed variance is the minimum necessary to allow for the requested use;</li>
<li>The proposed variance will comply with Section IV F.9 (mitigation) and Section VII (erosion control); and</li>
<li>The proposed use complies with the standards of the base zone.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>G.</strong> Variance Conditions<br/>
The Planning Commission may impose such conditions as are deemed necessary to limit any adverse impacts that may result from granting relief. If a variance is granted pursuant to Subsections E 1-6, the variance shall be subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The minimum width of the vegetated corridor shall be 15 feet on each side of a Primary Protected Water Feature, except as allowed in Section IV C and D;</li>
<li>No more than 25 percent of the length of the Water Quality Resource Area for a Primary Protected Water Feature within a development site can be less than 30 feet in width on each side of the water feature; and</li>
<li>In either case, the average width of the Water Quality Resource Area shall be a minimum of 15 feet on each side for Secondary Protected Water Features, a minimum of 50 feet on each side for Primary Protected Water Features, or up to 200 feet on each side in areas with slopes greater than 25 percent. The stream shall be allowed to meander within this area, but in no case shall the stream be less than 10 feet from the outer boundary of the Water Quality Resource Area.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Plans</strong> - The drawings and designs that specify construction details.</p>
<p><strong>Practicable</strong> - means available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Protected Water Features</strong><br/>
Primary Protected Water Features shall include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a.</strong> wetlands; and</li>
<li><strong>b.</strong> rivers, streams, and drainages downstream from the point at which 100 acres or more are drained to that water feature (regardless of whether it carries year-round flow); and</li>
<li><strong>c.</strong> streams carrying year-round flow; and</li>
<li><strong>d.</strong> springs which feed streams and wetlands and have year-round flow and</li>
<li><strong>e.</strong> natural lakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary Protected Water Features shall include intermittent streams and seeps downstream of the point at which 50 acres are drained and upstream of the point at which 100 acres are drained to that water feature.</p>
<p><strong>Restoration</strong> - the process of returning a disturbed or altered area or feature to a previously existing natural condition. Restoration activities reestablish the structure, function, and/or diversity to that which occurred prior to impacts caused by human activity.</p>
<p><strong>“Resource” versus “Facility”</strong> - The distinction being made is between a “resource,” a functioning natural system such as a wetland or stream; and a “facility” which refers to a created or constructed structure or drainage way that is designed, constructed and maintained to collect and filter, retain, or detain surface water run-off during and after a storm event for the purpose of water quality improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Riparian</strong> -Those areas associated with streams, lakes and wetlands where vegetation communities are predominately influenced by their association with water.</p>
<p><strong>Routine Repair and Maintenance</strong> - activities directed at preserving an existing allowed use or facility, without expanding the development footprint or site use.</p>
<p><strong>Stormwater Pre-treatment Facility</strong> - any structure or drainage way that is designed, constructed, and maintained to collect and filter, retain, or detain surface water runoff during and after a storm event for the purpose of water quality improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Stream</strong> - a body of running water moving over the earth’s surface in a channel or bed, such as a creek, rivulet or river. It flows at least part of the year, including perennial and intermittent streams. Streams are dynamic in nature and their structure is maintained through build-up and loss of sediment.</p>
<p><strong>Structure</strong> - A building or other major improvement that is built, constructed or installed, not including minor improvements, such as utility poles, flagpoles or irrigation system components, that are not customarily regulated through zoning codes. Fences and decks are considered structures for the purpose of this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>Top of Bank</strong> - The same as “bankful stage” defined in OAR 141-85-010(2).</p>
<p><strong>Utility Facilities</strong> - buildings, structures or any constructed portion of a system which provides for the production, transmission, conveyance, delivery or furnishing of services including, but not limited to, heat, light, water, power, natural gas, sanitary sewer, stormwater, telephone and cable television. Utility facilities do not include stormwater pretreatment facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Variance</strong> - means a discretionary decision to permit modification of the terms of an implementing ordinance based on a demonstration of unusual hardship or exceptional circumstances unique to a specific property.</p>
<p><strong>Vegetated Corridor</strong> - the area of setback between the top of bank of a Protected Water Feature and the delineated edge of the Water Quality Resource Area as defined in Table 1.</p>
<p><strong>Visible or Measurable Erosion</strong> - Visible or measurable erosion includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>Deposits of mud, dirt sediment or similar material exceeding one-half cubic foot in volume on public or private streets, adjacent property, or onto the storm and surface water system, either by direct deposit, dropping discharge, or as a result of the action of erosion. Evidence of concentrated flows of water over bare soils; turbid or sediment laden flows; or evidence of on-site erosion such as rivulets on bare soil slopes, where the flow of water is not filtered or captured on the site. Earth slides, mudflows, earth sloughing, or other earth movement that leaves the property.</p>
<p><strong>Water Quality Resource Areas</strong> - The Protected Water Feature and the adjacent Vegetated Corridor as established in this ordinance.</p>
<p><strong>Watershed</strong> - A watershed is a geographic unit defined by the flows of rainwater or snowmelt. All land in a watershed drains to a common outlet, such as a stream, lake or wetland.</p>
<p><strong>Wetlands</strong> - Wetlands are those areas inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands are those areas identified and delineated by a qualified wetland specialist as set forth in the most recent Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual and created wetlands.</p>

<figcaption>Diagrams showing how to measure slope in 50-foot areas for determining vegetated corridor widths</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong>
• Provides protection for most steep slopes, yet corridor widths can be varied to fit a number of different situations (corridor widths include 50 feet to 100 feet, 125 feet, 150 feet, 175 feet, and 200 feet)
• Provides flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
• Does not protect slopes that rise steeply after a gradual “floodplain” area.</p>
